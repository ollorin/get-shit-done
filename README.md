## How It Works

Four commands, one loop:

```
/gsd:discuss-phase N   → capture your decisions before planning
/gsd:plan-phase N      → research → create atomic plans → verify
/gsd:execute-phase N   → run plans in parallel waves, commit per task
/gsd:verify-work N     → UAT walk-through, auto-fix plans for failures
```

Each plan executes in a fresh 200k context window. No degradation. Git history is clean — one commit per task, automatically.

Start a project: `/gsd:new-project` — questions → research → requirements → roadmap.

Full cycle when all phases done: `/gsd:complete-milestone` → `/gsd:new-milestone`.

---

## Commands

### Core Workflow

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/gsd:new-project` | Initialize: questions → research → requirements → roadmap |
| `/gsd:discuss-phase [N]` | Lock implementation decisions before planning |
| `/gsd:plan-phase [N]` | Research + create plans + verify against requirements |
| `/gsd:execute-phase <N>` | Execute all plans in parallel waves |
| `/gsd:verify-work [N]` | Manual UAT, auto-generates fix plans |
| `/gsd:complete-milestone` | Archive milestone, tag release |
| `/gsd:new-milestone [name]` | Start next version |

### Quick Mode

```
/gsd:quick
```

GSD guarantees (atomic commits, state tracking) without full planning. Use for bug fixes and one-off tasks.

### Utilities

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/gsd:progress` | Where am I, what's next |
| `/gsd:map-codebase` | Analyze existing codebase before new-project |
| `/gsd:pause-work` / `/gsd:resume-work` | Session handoff |
| `/gsd:set-profile <auto\|quality\|balanced\|budget>` | Switch model profile |
| `/gsd:settings` | Configure workflow agents and execution |
| `/gsd:add-phase` / `/gsd:insert-phase` / `/gsd:remove-phase` | Roadmap management |
| `/gsd:add-todo` / `/gsd:check-todos` | Capture ideas |
| `/gsd:debug` | Systematic debugging with persistent state |
| `/gsd:update` | Update GSD |

## v2.0 Enhancements (This Fork)

This fork extends the base GSD system with autonomous execution, a persistent knowledge database, Telegram integration, and conversation mining. Built across 12 phases.

### What Was Built

**Auto Mode (Phases 1–2)**
Intelligent model selection using complexity signals. Haiku for simple tasks, Sonnet for standard, Opus for complex — with circuit breakers, iteration caps, error escalation, and a feedback loop that learns from corrections. 40–60% token savings vs all-Sonnet.

**Knowledge System (Phases 3–4)**
Local SQLite + sqlite-vec knowledge database at `.planning/knowledge/{user}.db`. Stores decisions, lessons, summaries with TTL lifecycle, vector + FTS5 search, and type-weighted ranking (decisions/lessons score 2× vs summaries). Passive extraction via Claude Code hooks captures knowledge during normal work. Three-stage deduplication: content hash → canonical hash → embedding similarity (0.88 threshold). Memory evolves — similar new knowledge updates existing entries rather than creating duplicates.

**Autonomous Execution (Phases 6–7)**
`/gsd:execute-roadmap` — runs an entire project roadmap unattended. Opus coordinator spawns per-phase sub-coordinators, each with fresh context. Token budget monitoring (alerts at 80%), failure handling with retry/skip/escalate, task chunking for large plans, and parallel execution for independent phases.

**Telegram MCP Server (Phases 8, 8.1)**
MCP server (`mcp-servers/telegram-mcp/`) that auto-loads with Claude Code. Sends blocking questions to your phone when human input is needed, resumes automatically on reply. Voice message support via local Whisper (no API cost). Multi-instance safe — each Claude Code session has isolated question queues with file locking and UUID-based session IDs.

**Doc Compression (Phase 9)**
PreToolUse hook intercepts reads of GSD planning documents and injects compressed summaries (60–70% token reduction) with absolute file links. Cache invalidated on content change. Circuit breaker disables compression after 3 failures.

**Installation System (Phase 10)**
Single command installs all dependencies, hooks, MCP config, and Whisper models:
```bash
npm run install:gsd
```

**Session Knowledge Extraction (Phase 11)**
Haiku analyzes completed Telegram MCP sessions at close time, extracting decisions and reasoning patterns beyond regex matching. Quality gates, chunking for long sessions, deduplication against the knowledge DB, and re-analysis prevention via content hash.

**Historical Conversation Mining (Phase 12)**
Mines `~/.claude/projects/{slug}/*.jsonl` for knowledge — the entire Claude Code conversation history. Format adapter converts Claude Code JSONL (97.5% noise removed) to Phase 11-compatible entries, then spawns Haiku subagents to extract insights.

## Fork Setup & Operations

### Install from Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_FORK/get-shit-done.git
cd get-shit-done
cp .env.template .env
# Fill in TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_OWNER_ID in .env
npm run install:gsd
```

This installs npm dependencies, Whisper models, Claude Code hooks, and MCP server config.

### Update from Fork

```bash
cd /path/to/get-shit-done
git pull origin main
npm run install:gsd   # reinstalls hooks, MCP config if changed
```

If you have local patches to GSD skills/commands, run `/gsd:reapply-patches` after updating.

### Apply to a Different Project

The install script deploys hooks and MCP config globally to `~/.claude/`. Once done, the knowledge system and Telegram integration work in any project — point Claude Code at your project directory and start.

The knowledge DB is per-project (`.planning/knowledge/{user}.db`) and global (`~/.claude/knowledge/{user}.db`). Both are created automatically on first use.

### Initialize the Knowledge Database

No explicit init step needed. The DB creates itself on first access. Verify it's working:

```bash
node get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js knowledge status
# → {"available": true, "db_path": ".../.planning/knowledge/ollorin.db"}

node get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js knowledge stats
# → entry counts by type and scope
```

### Mine Past Conversations

**From `~/.claude/projects/` (Claude Code conversation history):**

```bash
# Discover what's ready to mine, then process via Haiku subagents
node get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js mine-conversations --max-age-days 90

# Or run the full orchestrated workflow in Claude Code:
# (ask Claude to run the mine-conversations workflow)
# @get-shit-done/workflows/mine-conversations.md
```

Options: `--max-age-days N` (default 30), `--limit N`, `--include-subagents`.
Already-analyzed conversations are skipped via content hash.

**From `.planning/telegram-sessions/` (Telegram session history):**

```bash
# List sessions pending analysis
node get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js list-pending-sessions

# Run full analysis (spawns Haiku per session)
# @get-shit-done/workflows/analyze-pending-sessions.md
```

Both workflows are idempotent — safe to re-run. Results stored in `.planning/knowledge/`.

---

## Telegram Setup

1. Message `@BotFather` → `/newbot` → copy token
2. Add to `.env`:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here
   TELEGRAM_OWNER_ID=your_telegram_user_id
   ```
3. The MCP server starts automatically with Claude Code (configured by `npm run install:gsd`)
4. Send `/start` to your bot in Telegram

Voice messages: install `ffmpeg` (`brew install ffmpeg`) — Whisper model is downloaded by the installer.

---

## Configuration

Settings in `.planning/config.json`. Change via `/gsd:settings`.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `mode` | `interactive` | `yolo` = auto-approve all steps |
| `depth` | `standard` | Planning thoroughness |
| `parallelization.enabled` | `true` | Run independent plans in parallel |
| `git.branching_strategy` | `none` | `phase` or `milestone` to create branches |

**Model profiles** (`/gsd:set-profile`):

| Profile | Planning | Execution | Verification |
|---------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| `auto` | adaptive | adaptive | adaptive |
| `quality` | Opus | Opus | Sonnet |
| `balanced` | Opus | Sonnet | Sonnet |
| `budget` | Sonnet | Sonnet | Haiku |

`auto` uses complexity signals (task type, file count, keywords) to route each task to the cheapest model that can handle it — Haiku for simple reads and docs, Sonnet for standard work, Opus for architecture and complex decisions. Circuit breakers and error escalation ensure quality.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Commands not found after install** — restart Claude Code, verify `~/.claude/commands/gsd/` exists.

**Docker / CI** — set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/home/user/.claude` before installing.

**Telegram bot not responding** — check `.env` has correct token, send `/start` to bot first.

**Voice messages not working** — `brew install ffmpeg`, check Whisper model downloaded.
