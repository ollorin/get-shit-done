<role>
You are a phase coordinator. You execute the full lifecycle of a single phase: discuss -> research -> plan -> execute -> verify. You create checkpoints after each major step to enable resume on failure.

Spawned by: execute-roadmap.md coordinator

Optional input: `telegram_topic_id` — the Telegram forum thread_id for this roadmap execution (passed by execute-roadmap coordinator). If provided, all send_message and send_status_update calls route to this thread. If absent or null, calls continue to route to the main group (no change to existing behavior).

Your job: Complete the phase cycle autonomously, returning structured state for the parent coordinator.
</role>

<execution_cycle>

Initialize:
```
telegram_topic_id = {value from prompt if provided, else null}
// All mcp__telegram__send_message and mcp__telegram__send_status_update calls
// below pass thread_id: telegram_topic_id (omit parameter if null)
```

// Parent coordinator passes telegram_topic_id in the prompt:
// "telegram_topic_id: {telegram_topic_id}" or "telegram_topic_id: null"

// Helper: append_notification_log(event, data)
// After EVERY mcp__telegram__send_message call that is a lifecycle notification
// (NOT escalation calls — those already log via the escalation block):
//   Append JSON line to .planning/telegram-sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}.jsonl
//   Format: {"type":"notification","event":"{event}","timestamp":"{ISO}","phase":{N},...extra_data}
//   Create the file if it does not exist. Use current date for filename.

**Notification 1 — Phase start** (fires immediately after initialization, before any step):

```
if telegram_topic_id is not null:
  mcp__telegram__send_message({
    text: "Phase {phase_number} started: {phase_name}",
    ...(telegram_topic_id ? { thread_id: telegram_topic_id } : {})
  })
  // JSONL: {"type":"notification","event":"phase_start","timestamp":"{ISO}","phase":{N},"phase_name":"{name}"}
  // Append above line to .planning/telegram-sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}.jsonl
```


<context_budget_monitoring>

## Context Budget Monitoring

Monitor context window usage at the start of each major step. Initialize these state variables once:

```
COMPRESSED_MODE_THRESHOLD = 0.60   // 60% -- switch to compressed output mode
FRESH_SUBAGENT_THRESHOLD = 0.80    // 80% -- consider fresh subagent for verifier
compressed_mode_notified = false   // track whether 60% notification was sent
fresh_subagent_notified = false    // track whether 80% notification was sent
context_budget_pct = 0.0           // current estimated usage percentage
```

**How to estimate context usage:**

Claude Code reports context window usage in the environment. Check it at the start of each major step (harvest_knowledge, discuss, research, plan, execute each plan, verify). If the runtime does not expose this directly, use a conservative heuristic: estimate 5-10% per major step completed.

**Compressed mode (at >= 60% context usage):**

When context_budget_pct >= COMPRESSED_MODE_THRESHOLD:
- Switch to terse output: use bullet points only, skip verbose reasoning narration
- Omit intermediate planning commentary -- act and report results concisely
- Skip optional diagnostic log messages
- Send ONE Telegram notification (on first threshold crossing only):

```
if context_budget_pct >= COMPRESSED_MODE_THRESHOLD AND NOT compressed_mode_notified:
  if telegram_topic_id is not null:
    mcp__telegram__send_message({
      text: "Phase {phase_number}: context at {usage_pct}% -- switching to compressed mode",
      ...(telegram_topic_id ? { thread_id: telegram_topic_id } : {})
    })
  compressed_mode_notified = true
  // Log to JSONL: {"type":"context_budget","event":"compressed_mode","timestamp":"{ISO}","phase":{N},"usage_pct":{usage_pct}}
```

**Fresh-subagent consideration (at >= 80% context usage):**

When context_budget_pct >= FRESH_SUBAGENT_THRESHOLD:
- Before spawning the verifier: create a compact handoff summary containing: phase goal, key decisions made, tasks completed, files modified
- Pass this handoff summary in the verifier subagent prompt so the verifier has full context without relying on the coordinator context window
- Send ONE Telegram notification (on first threshold crossing only):

```
if context_budget_pct >= FRESH_SUBAGENT_THRESHOLD AND NOT fresh_subagent_notified:
  if telegram_topic_id is not null:
    mcp__telegram__send_message({
      text: "Phase {phase_number}: context at {usage_pct}% -- passing handoff summary to verifier",
      ...(telegram_topic_id ? { thread_id: telegram_topic_id } : {})
    })
  fresh_subagent_notified = true
  // Log to JSONL: {"type":"context_budget","event":"fresh_subagent","timestamp":"{ISO}","phase":{N},"usage_pct":{usage_pct}}
  // Build handoff_summary:
  handoff_summary = """
  Phase {phase_number}: {phase_name}
  Goal: {phase_goal}
  Steps completed: {steps_completed}
  Key decisions: {key_decisions_from_CONTEXT.md}
  Files modified: {files_modified_so_far}
  """
```

**Handoff summary injection in verifier spawn:**

When spawning the verifier subagent (verify step), if fresh_subagent_notified is true:
- Append the handoff_summary to the verifier prompt under a <context_handoff> tag
- This ensures the verifier has all required context even when spawned from a nearly-full coordinator context window

**Non-fatal:** Context budget monitoring never blocks execution. If usage cannot be determined, default to 0% and proceed normally.

</context_budget_monitoring>

<step name="harvest_knowledge">
Mine recent Claude Code sessions for decisions and reasoning before planning begins.

```bash
HARVEST=$(node /Users/ollorin/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js \
  mine-conversations --all-projects --max-age-days 3 --limit 5 2>/dev/null || echo '{"status":"error"}')
```

Parse HARVEST JSON. Extract `status`, `sessionsReady`, `sessions`.

**If `status === 'error'` or `sessionsReady === 0`:** Log "Knowledge harvest: no new sessions" and continue to discuss step.

**Otherwise:** For each session in `sessions` (process sequentially):

1. For each item in `session.extractionRequests` (up to 3 — decision, reasoning_pattern, meta_knowledge):

   ```
   Agent(
     subagent_type="general-purpose",
     model="haiku",
     description="Extract {item.type}",
     max_turns=15,
     prompt="{item.prompt}"
   )
   ```

   Collect Haiku output text. If Agent() throws or returns empty, skip this extraction type and continue.

2. Assemble results array from successful outputs:
   ```json
   [
     {"type": "decision", "result": "{haikuOutput1}"},
     {"type": "reasoning_pattern", "result": "{haikuOutput2}"},
     {"type": "meta_knowledge", "result": "{haikuOutput3}"}
   ]
   ```

3. Store results:
   ```bash
   node /Users/ollorin/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js \
     store-conversation-result "{session.sessionId}" '{resultsJson}' \
     --content-hash "{session.contentHash}"
   ```

   Log: "Harvested {session.sessionId}: {stored} stored, {evolved} evolved, {skipped} skipped"

**Non-fatal:** If any session fails entirely, log the error and continue to the next session. If the whole step fails, log and proceed to discuss step — never block the phase lifecycle.
</step>

<step name="discuss">
Check if phase already has a CONTEXT.md (meaning discussion was already done):

```bash
ls .planning/phases/{phase_dir}/*-CONTEXT.md 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_CONTEXT"
```

<!-- SKIP PATH: CONTEXT.md exists — discussion already done -->
**If CONTEXT.md exists:** Skip discuss step. Create checkpoint with status: "skipped". Log: "Discuss step skipped — CONTEXT.md exists". Proceed directly to the research step.

```json
{
  "phase": {N},
  "step": "discuss",
  "status": "skipped",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "files_created": [],
  "context_file": null
}
```

After creating the skipped checkpoint, send context_ready notification (skip variant):

```
if telegram_topic_id is not null:
  mcp__telegram__send_message({
    text: "Phase {phase_number} context ready — CONTEXT.md already exists (discuss step skipped)",
    ...(telegram_topic_id ? { thread_id: telegram_topic_id } : {})
  })
  // JSONL: {"type":"notification","event":"context_ready","timestamp":"{ISO}","phase":{N},"autonomous_count":0,"escalated_count":0,"skipped":true}
  // Append above line to .planning/telegram-sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}.jsonl
```

<!-- RUN PATH: No CONTEXT.md — run gray-area identification -->
**If no CONTEXT.md:** Run gray-area identification (see below), then proceed to question generation (Plan 22-02 adds that step).

**Gray-area identification:**

1. Read the phase entry from ROADMAP.md to get the goal, requirements, and success criteria:
```bash
node /Users/ollorin/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js roadmap get-phase {phase_number}
```

2. Analyze the phase domain using these heuristics to determine what type of phase this is:
   - **What is this phase delivering?** (capability type: agent, CLI command, workflow, schema, etc.)
   - **For agent phases** → interface contracts, behavior modes, error handling, output format matter
   - **For CLI phases** → flag design, output format, error recovery, verbosity matter
   - **For workflow phases** → step sequencing, skip conditions, state persistence, failure handling matter
   - **For schema/data phases** → field choices, relationships, migration behavior, naming conventions matter

3. Produce a list of 3-5 **phase-specific** gray areas. Each gray area must be:
   - A concrete named area (NOT generic: not "UI", "Behavior" — specific: "Answer confidence threshold", "CONTEXT.md section structure")
   - Named after the actual implementation concern it represents
   - Distinct from the others (no overlapping scope)

   Example output format:
   ```
   Gray areas identified:
   1. CONTEXT.md section structure — what sections, ordering, and field names the output file uses
   2. Confidence threshold for autonomous vs escalated answers — numeric cutoff and how it is measured
   3. Question generation scope — how many questions per gray area and how to avoid redundant questions
   ```

4. Store identified gray areas in a variable for the question generation step.

**Question generation:**

For each gray area identified above, generate 10-20 concrete, answerable questions. These questions will be used to query the knowledge DB — they must be specific enough to retrieve relevant stored decisions and context.

**Question generation strategy (Claude reasoning inline — no subagent spawn):**

For each gray area:
1. Start from the gray area name and the phase goal/requirements read in step 1 above
2. Ask internally: "What specific implementation decision within this gray area could go multiple ways?"
3. Generate questions at 3 specificity levels:
   - **high**: Pattern/approach question — "Should X run inline in the coordinator or spawn a subagent?"
   - **mid**: Specific parameters question — "What is the minimum confidence score to mark an answer as sufficient?"
   - **low**: Edge case question — "What happens when the knowledge DB has no results for a question?"
4. Target scale: simple gray areas → 10 questions, complex gray areas → 20 questions

**Question output format:**

Produce a `questions` array in this structure:
```
questions = [
  {
    gray_area: "Answer confidence threshold",
    question: "What confidence score threshold should mark a meta-answerer response as sufficient vs needs-escalation?",
    specificity: "mid"
  },
  {
    gray_area: "Answer confidence threshold",
    question: "Should the confidence threshold be a fixed value or configurable per phase type?",
    specificity: "high"
  },
  {
    gray_area: "Answer confidence threshold",
    question: "What happens when all questions for a gray area score below the confidence threshold?",
    specificity: "low"
  },
  ...
]
```

Store the full `questions` array in a variable for the meta-answerer invocation step.

**Create checkpoint after question generation:**
```json
{
  "phase": {N},
  "step": "discuss",
  "status": "questions_generated",
  "gray_areas": ["area1", "area2", "area3"],
  "question_count": 47,
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

**Spawn meta-answerer to answer questions:**

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="gsd-meta-answerer",
  model="haiku",
  description="Answer phase {phase_number} questions",
  max_turns=15,
  prompt="
    <phase_context>
    Phase: {phase_number}
    Goal: {phase_goal}
    Requirements: {requirements_list}
    </phase_context>

    <questions>
    {questions_json_array}
    </questions>
  "
)
```

Parse the returned JSON response from the Agent() call — the `answers` array and `stats` object per the gsd-meta-answerer output format.

**Answer evaluation logic:**

Confidence threshold: `0.7` — answers at or above 0.7 are marked `sufficient`; below 0.7 are marked `needs-escalation`.

For each answer in the answers array:
- If `answer.confidence >= 0.7` AND NOT `answer.no_results`: mark as `sufficient`
- If `answer.confidence < 0.7` OR `answer.no_results`: mark as `needs-escalation`
- If `answer.error` is present: mark as `needs-escalation`

Group results:
```
sufficient_answers = answers where evaluation == "sufficient"
escalation_needed = answers where evaluation == "needs-escalation"
```

**Sensitivity check for escalation:**

Before escalating any needs-escalation item to Telegram, evaluate it against six sensitivity criteria. Only escalate if ANY criterion is true:

1. **Irreversible change** — Would implementing this answer result in a change that cannot be undone without significant effort? (e.g., deleting data, migrating schema, public API contract)
2. **>1 phase rework risk** — If wrong, would this require reworking more than one future phase?
3. **Major architectural decision** — Does this affect the overall system design, component boundaries, or data model in a non-trivial way?
4. **Money/data loss potential** — Could a wrong decision lead to loss of user data, financial charges, or security breach?
5. **Conflicting KB signals** — Do the knowledge DB results for this question directly contradict each other (different answers with similar confidence)?
6. **Always-ask topic** — Does the question involve a topic the user has previously indicated they always want to decide personally?

For each item in `escalation_needed`:
- Apply the six criteria above based on the question text, gray_area, and answer.confidence
- If NO criterion matches → move to Claude's Discretion (confidence >= 0.4 already handled by existing logic)
- If ANY criterion matches → mark as `sensitive_escalation: true`

Produce:
```
sensitive_items = escalation_needed items where sensitive_escalation == true
discretion_items = escalation_needed items where sensitive_escalation == false
```

**Escalate sensitive items via Telegram (multi-turn loop with JSONL logging):**

For each item in `sensitive_items`, run a multi-turn follow-up loop:

Initialize loop state: `turn = 1`, `max_turns = 3`, `sufficient = false`, `question_text = item.question`.

Update session status to 'waiting' once before the loop begins:
```
mcp__telegram__update_session_status({ status: "waiting", question_title: item.question.slice(0, 50) })
```

**Loop (repeat while sufficient == false AND turn <= max_turns):**

**Step A — Send question and receive reply:**
Call ask_blocking_question — this BLOCKS until the user replies:
```
reply = mcp__telegram__ask_blocking_question({
  question: question_text,
  context: "Phase {phase_number} — {phase_name}\nGray area: {item.gray_area}\nMeta-answerer confidence: {item.confidence}\nSensitivity reason: {which criterion triggered}",
  timeout_minutes: 30
})
```

Immediately after sending (before reply arrives), append a JSON line to `.planning/telegram-sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}.jsonl` (where the date is the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format, creating the file if it does not exist):
```
{"type":"escalation_question","timestamp":"{ISO}","phase":{phase_number},"gray_area":"{item.gray_area}","question":"{question_text}","turn":{turn},"sensitivity_reason":"{which criterion triggered}"}
```

**Step B — Evaluate reply confidence:**
Read the reply text inline and assign confidence using these rules:
- If the reply contains a clear, actionable decision ("use X", "yes", "no", a specific path name, or a code identifier) → `confidence = 0.85`, `sufficient = true`
- If the reply is a general direction or preference but lacks specific actionable detail → `confidence = 0.65`, `sufficient = false`
- If the reply asks Claude to decide, defers the question, or is otherwise non-committal → `confidence = 0.5`, `sufficient = false`

Append a JSON line to `.planning/telegram-sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}.jsonl`:
```
{"type":"escalation_reply","timestamp":"{ISO}","phase":{phase_number},"gray_area":"{item.gray_area}","reply":"{reply text}","turn":{turn},"confidence_eval":{confidence},"sufficient":{true|false}}
```

**Step C — Decide whether to loop:**
- If `sufficient == true` OR `turn >= max_turns` → exit loop, use current reply as final answer
- If `sufficient == false` AND `turn < max_turns` → increment turn, construct a follow-up question:
  ```
  question_text = "Thanks for your reply. To be more specific: {synthesize what is still unclear from the original question and the reply received so far}"
  ```
  Then loop back to Step A with the follow-up question text

**After loop exits:**

Update session status back to 'busy':
```
mcp__telegram__update_session_status({ status: "busy" })
```

Append a JSON line to `.planning/telegram-sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}.jsonl` recording the completed exchange:
```
{"type":"escalation_complete","timestamp":"{ISO}","phase":{phase_number},"gray_area":"{item.gray_area}","final_answer":"{last reply}","turns_used":{turn},"escalated_to_discretion":false}
```

Store the final reply (last reply received regardless of confidence):
```
escalated_answers.push({
  gray_area: item.gray_area,
  question: item.question,
  answer: reply,
  source: "telegram_escalation",
  confidence: 1.0
})
```

// Write to KB immediately after each answer so the DB is updated even if later escalations fail or timeout
**Write escalated answer to knowledge DB (inside loop — non-fatal):**

```bash
GSD_KB_CONTENT="{item.question}: {item.answer}" \
GSD_KB_CONTEXT="Phase {phase_number} Telegram escalation — {item.gray_area}" \
node -e "
const { storeInsights } = require(process.env.HOME + '/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/knowledge-writer.js');
storeInsights([{
  type: 'decision',
  decision: process.env.GSD_KB_CONTENT,
  confidence: 1.0,
  context_snippet: process.env.GSD_KB_CONTEXT
}], { scope: 'global' })
.then(r => process.stderr.write('[coordinator] KB write: ' + JSON.stringify(r) + '\n'))
.catch(e => process.stderr.write('[coordinator] KB write failed: ' + e.message + '\n'));
" || true
```

After all sensitive_items processed, `escalated_answers` holds human-provided answers.

**Merge escalated answers with sufficient answers for CONTEXT.md:**

The CONTEXT.md writer below uses `sufficient_answers` to populate the Implementation Decisions section. Append `escalated_answers` to `sufficient_answers` before writing CONTEXT.md, so all answered questions (autonomous + human-escalated) appear in the decisions section.

The `discretion_items` array goes into the Claude's Discretion subsection (unchanged from Phase 22 behavior for non-sensitive items).

Log needs-escalation items to the checkpoint:
```json
{
  "phase": {N},
  "step": "discuss",
  "status": "answers_evaluated",
  "sufficient_count": N,
  "escalation_count": N,
  "avg_confidence": "X.XX",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

**Write CONTEXT.md from sufficient answers:**

1. Create or find phase directory (already available from init):
```bash
mkdir -p ".planning/phases/{phase_dir}"
```

2. Write CONTEXT.md at `.planning/phases/{phase_dir}/{padded_phase}-CONTEXT.md` using this template structure:

```markdown
# Phase {N}: {phase_name} - Context

**Gathered:** {current_date}
**Source:** Autonomous (gsd-meta-answerer)
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

{phase_goal from ROADMAP.md — verbatim}

</domain>

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions

{For each gray_area with sufficient_answers:}
### {gray_area name}
{For each sufficient answer in this gray area:}
- {answer.question}: {answer.answer} (confidence: {answer.confidence})

### Claude's Discretion
{List questions from discretion_items (needs-escalation items with confidence >= 0.4 that did not trigger any sensitivity criterion). Claude decides these autonomously.}

### Escalated Decisions (Human-Answered)
{If escalated_answers.length > 0: list each item with format "- {answer.question}: {answer.answer} (answered via Telegram)". If none: omit this subsection.}

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

{Extract any concrete examples, references, or specific patterns from sufficient answers. If none: "No specific requirements — open to standard approaches"}

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

{List questions from escalation_needed where confidence < 0.7 that require human input. Note: Phase 23 will escalate these via Telegram.}
{If all answers sufficient: "None — all gray areas resolved autonomously"}

</deferred>

---

*Phase: {padded_phase}-{phase_slug}*
*Context gathered: {current_date}*
*KB answers: {sufficient_count} | Claude's Discretion: {discretion_count} | Escalated: {escalated_count}*
```

3. Write the file.

4. Commit the context file:
```bash
node /Users/ollorin/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js commit "docs({padded_phase}): autonomous discuss step — write phase context" --files ".planning/phases/{phase_dir}/{padded_phase}-CONTEXT.md"
```

5. Create the final discuss step checkpoint:
```json
{
  "phase": {N},
  "phase_name": "...",
  "last_step": "discuss",
  "step_status": "complete",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "files_touched": ["{phase_dir}/{padded_phase}-CONTEXT.md"],
  "key_context": "Autonomous discuss: {sufficient_count} KB answers, {discretion_count} Claude discretion, {escalated_count} Telegram-escalated",
  "resume_from": "research"
}
```

6. Log the discuss completion.

**Notification 2 — Context ready** (fires after discuss step completes — CONTEXT.md written and committed):

```
if telegram_topic_id is not null:
  mcp__telegram__send_message({
    text: "Phase {phase_number} context ready — {sufficient_count} KB answers, {discretion_count} Claude decisions, {escalated_count} Telegram-escalated",
    ...(telegram_topic_id ? { thread_id: telegram_topic_id } : {})
  })
  // JSONL: {"type":"notification","event":"context_ready","timestamp":"{ISO}","phase":{N},"kb_count":{sufficient_count},"discretion_count":{discretion_count},"escalated_count":{escalated_count}}
  // Append above line to .planning/telegram-sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}.jsonl
```

The execution cycle then proceeds to the `research` step.
</step>

<step name="research">
Check if phase needs research:

```bash
ls .planning/phases/{phase_dir}/*-RESEARCH.md 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_RESEARCH"
```

**If RESEARCH.md exists:** Skip research, create checkpoint with status: "skipped"

**If no RESEARCH.md:**
1. Run research workflow internally using `/gsd:research-phase {phase}`
2. Wait for research completion
3. Verify RESEARCH.md created
4. Create checkpoint: `{ step: "research", status: "complete", files: [...] }`

**Checkpoint format:**
```json
{
  "phase": {N},
  "step": "research",
  "status": "complete" | "skipped" | "failed",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "files_created": [...],
  "key_findings": "..."
}
```

**Notification 3 — Research done** (fires only when status is "complete" — NOT when skipped):

```
if telegram_topic_id is not null AND research_status == "complete":
  mcp__telegram__send_message({
    text: "Phase {phase_number} research done",
    ...(telegram_topic_id ? { thread_id: telegram_topic_id } : {})
  })
  // JSONL: {"type":"notification","event":"research_done","timestamp":"{ISO}","phase":{N}}
  // Append above line to .planning/telegram-sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}.jsonl
```
</step>

<step name="plan">
Check if phase needs planning:

```bash
ls .planning/phases/{phase_dir}/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_PLANS"
```

**If PLAN.md files exist:** Skip planning, create checkpoint with status: "skipped"

**If no plans:**

Spawn gsd-planner explicitly — do NOT plan inline in context:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="gsd-planner",
  model="{planner_model}",
  description="Plan phase {phase_number}",
  prompt="
    <planning_context>
    Phase: {phase_number}
    Phase goal: {goal from ROADMAP.md}
    <files_to_read>
    - .planning/phases/{phase_dir}/*-CONTEXT.md
    - .planning/phases/{phase_dir}/*-RESEARCH.md
    - .planning/STATE.md
    - .planning/ROADMAP.md
    </files_to_read>
    </planning_context>
    Write PLAN.md files to: .planning/phases/{phase_dir}/
    Return: ## PLANNING COMPLETE
  "
)
```

After planner returns, **hard-verify files on disk**:
```bash
PLAN_COUNT=$(ls .planning/phases/{phase_dir}/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
echo "PLAN_COUNT=$PLAN_COUNT"
```

**If PLAN_COUNT == 0:** CRITICAL — do NOT proceed to execute. Return failure state:
```json
{ "status": "failed", "step": "plan", "reason": "gsd-planner returned success but no PLAN.md files found on disk" }
```

**Plan structure gate:** After PLAN_COUNT check passes, run structural validation on each plan before proceeding:

```bash
GATE_FAILURES=0
for plan_file in .planning/phases/{phase_dir}/*-PLAN.md; do
  VALIDATION_OUTPUT=$(node /Users/ollorin/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js verify plan-structure "$plan_file" 2>/dev/null)
  VALID=$(echo "$VALIDATION_OUTPUT" | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d.get('valid', True))" 2>/dev/null || echo "True")
  if [ "$VALID" = "False" ] || [ "$VALID" = "false" ]; then
    ERRORS=$(echo "$VALIDATION_OUTPUT" | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(', '.join(d.get('errors',[])))" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown errors")
    echo "PLAN STRUCTURE GATE FAILED: $plan_file — $ERRORS"
    GATE_FAILURES=$((GATE_FAILURES + 1))
  fi
done
```

**If GATE_FAILURES > 0:** CRITICAL — do NOT proceed to execute. Return failure state:
```json
{ "status": "failed", "step": "plan", "reason": "Plan structure gate: {N} plan(s) failed validation — missing tdd tasks or ui-qa checkpoints. See gate output above for details." }
```

Note: The gate runs for BOTH the run path (planner just returned) AND the skip path (plans already existed). If the validation tool itself fails to parse a plan (e.g., tool error), treat as non-blocking and continue — only hard-fail on explicit valid:false responses.

Create checkpoint: `{ step: "plan", status: "complete", plan_count: N }`

**Skip rationale:** Plans may already exist from a previous partial execution. Always prefer existing plans over re-planning to preserve prior decisions.

**Notification 4 — Plans ready** (fires only when status is "complete" — NOT when skipped):

```
if telegram_topic_id is not null AND plan_status == "complete":
  mcp__telegram__send_message({
    text: "Phase {phase_number} plans ready — {plan_count} plan(s)",

  // Append above line to .planning/telegram-sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}.jsonl
```
</step>

<step name="execute">
Execute all plans in the phase:

**Pre-flight: verify PLAN.md files exist before spawning any executor.**
```bash
PLAN_COUNT=$(ls .planning/phases/{phase_dir}/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
```
If PLAN_COUNT == 0: HARD STOP — return failure state. Never execute a phase without plans on disk.

**Pre-execution dependency drift check (advisory — never blocks execution):**
```bash
DRIFT_RESULT=$(node /Users/ollorin/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js verify dependency-stability {phase_number} 2>/dev/null || echo '{"drift_detected":false,"error":"drift check unavailable"}')
```

Parse DRIFT_RESULT JSON:
- If `drift_detected == true`: Log WARNING: "WARNING: Dependency drift detected for phase {phase_number} — files modified by intervening phases: {list drifted_files[].file and modified_by_phase}. Review if critical before proceeding. Continuing with execution."
- If `drift_detected == false` (and no error): Log: "Dependency stability check passed — no drift detected"
- If `error` field present or JSON parse fails: Log: "Dependency stability check skipped: {error}" — continue execution

**File conflict check for parallel execution (informational — never blocks):**
```bash
FILE_CONFLICTS=$(node /Users/ollorin/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js roadmap analyze --raw 2>/dev/null | node -e "let d='';process.stdin.on('data',c=>d+=c);process.stdin.on('end',()=>{try{const j=JSON.parse(d);console.log(JSON.stringify(j.file_conflicts||[]));}catch(e){console.log('[]');}})" 2>/dev/null || echo '[]')
```

Parse FILE_CONFLICTS JSON array:
- If non-empty: Log "FILE CONFLICTS DETECTED: The following files are claimed by multiple parallel-eligible phases — {for each conflict: file claimed by phases A, B}. Review before running phases in parallel."
- If empty: Log "No file conflicts detected among parallel-eligible phases"
- If parse fails: Log "File conflict check unavailable — skipping" and continue

```bash
# Check what plans exist and which have summaries
node /Users/ollorin/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js phase-plan-index {phase_number}
```

Check the model profile setting to determine if auto routing is active:

```bash
CONFIG_FILE=".planning/config.json"
if [ -f "$CONFIG_FILE" ]; then
  MODEL_PROFILE=$(jq -r '.model_profile // "quality"' "$CONFIG_FILE")
else
  MODEL_PROFILE="quality"
fi
echo "Model profile: $MODEL_PROFILE"
```

If MODEL_PROFILE is "auto", auto routing is active. Otherwise use sonnet as default.

For each incomplete plan (no SUMMARY.md):

1. **Describe what this plan builds** (read objective from PLAN.md)

2. **Determine execution mode:**

   **If MODEL_PROFILE is "auto":** Parse task-level tier tags from PLAN.md.

   ```
   TASK_TIERS = {}
   ROUTING_STATS = { haiku: 0, sonnet: 0, opus: 0 }
   For each <task> element in the plan (by task_index, 1-based):
     // Prefer <model> element (new format), fall back to [tier] name prefix (legacy)
     model_el = extract <model> element text if present (haiku|sonnet|opus)
     task_name = extract <name> element text
     If model_el matches /^(haiku|sonnet|opus)$/i:
       TASK_TIERS[task_index] = model_el (lowercase)
     Else If task_name matches /^\[(haiku|sonnet|opus)\]/i:
       TASK_TIERS[task_index] = matched tier (lowercase)  // legacy compat
     Else:
       TASK_TIERS[task_index] = "sonnet"  // default — no tier specified

   If at least one task has an explicit tier (via <model> or legacy prefix):
     PER_TASK_MODE = true
   Else:
     // Fall back to plan-level routing (plan has no tier info — older plan format)
     PER_TASK_MODE = false
     Read the plan objective (first line of <objective> tag in PLAN.md) as task description:
       PLAN_OBJECTIVE=$(grep -A1 '<objective>' {plan_file} | tail -1 | tr -d '\n')
     Spawn routing agent to get model recommendation:
       Agent(
         subagent_type="gsd-task-router",
         description="Route plan",
         max_turns=5,
         prompt="Route this task: {PLAN_OBJECTIVE}"
       )
     Parse the ROUTING DECISION response to extract the Model: line.
     Set EXECUTOR_MODEL to the returned model tier (haiku/sonnet/opus).
     Also capture ROUTING_SCORE and ROUTING_CONTEXT from the response.

     After extracting the decision, log it to EXECUTION_LOG.md (best-effort):
     ```bash
     node ~/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js execution-log event \
       --type routing_decision \
       --data "{\"phase\":{phase_number},\"plan\":\"{plan_number}\",\"model\":\"{EXECUTOR_MODEL}\",\"task\":\"{PLAN_OBJECTIVE}\"}"
     ```
   ```

   **If MODEL_PROFILE is NOT "auto":** PER_TASK_MODE = false, EXECUTOR_MODEL = "sonnet" (unchanged default behavior).

3. **Spawn executor agent:**

   **When PER_TASK_MODE is false** (non-auto profile or no tier tags — existing behavior):
   ```
   Agent(
     subagent_type="gsd-executor",
     model="{EXECUTOR_MODEL}",
     description="Execute plan {plan_number}",
     prompt="
       <objective>
       Execute plan {plan_number} of phase {phase_number}-{phase_name}.
       Commit each task atomically. Create SUMMARY.md. Update STATE.md.
       </objective>

       <execution_context>

       <files_to_read>
       - Plan: {phase_dir}/{plan_file}
       - State: .planning/STATE.md

       {IF_AUTO_PROFILE_AND_PLAN_LEVEL_ROUTING:

       Relevant context injected by router:
       {ROUTING_CONTEXT}
       </routing_context>
       }
     "
   )
   ```

   **When PER_TASK_MODE is true** (auto profile with tier tags — per-task routing):

   Spawn executors sequentially, one per task:

   ```
   For each task_index in TASK_TIERS (in dependency/wave order from PLAN.md):
     1. Read TASK_TIER = TASK_TIERS[task_index]

     2. Apply lightweight quota downgrade:
        QUOTA_JSON = run: node ~/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js quota status --json
        If quota command succeeds:
          session_percent = QUOTA_JSON.session.percent (numeric, e.g. 87.3)
          If session_percent > 95:
            TASK_TIER = "haiku"  // critical conservation
          Elif session_percent > 80 AND TASK_TIER == "opus":
            TASK_TIER = "sonnet"  // downgrade opus only
          // else: keep TASK_TIER as-is
        If quota command fails: keep TASK_TIER as-is (fail open)

     3. Track tier assignment: ROUTING_STATS[TASK_TIER] += 1

     4. Spawn per-task executor:
        Agent(
          subagent_type="gsd-executor",
          model="{TASK_TIER}",
          description="Execute task {task_index}",
          prompt="
            <objective>
            Execute task {task_index} of plan {plan_number} in phase {phase_number}-{phase_name}.
            Commit the task atomically. If this is the last task, create SUMMARY.md and update STATE.md.
            </objective>
            <execution_context>
            @/Users/ollorin/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/execute-plan.md
            @/Users/ollorin/.claude/get-shit-done/templates/summary.md
            @/Users/ollorin/.claude/get-shit-done/references/checkpoints.md
            @/Users/ollorin/.claude/get-shit-done/references/tdd.md
            </execution_context>
            <files_to_read>
            - Plan: {phase_dir}/{plan_file}
            - State: .planning/STATE.md
            - Config: .planning/config.json (if exists)
            </files_to_read>
            <routing_context>
            Per-task routing active. This task routed to {TASK_TIER}.
            Task index: {task_index}
            Quota at spawn: {session_percent}%
            </routing_context>
            <resume_from_task>{task_index}</resume_from_task>
          "
        )

     5. Log task dispatch to EXECUTION_LOG.md (best-effort, before waiting for result):
        ```bash
        node /Users/ollorin/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js execution-log event \
          --type task_dispatch \
          --data '{"phase":{phase_number},"plan":"{plan_file}","task_index":{task_index},"task_name":"{task_name}","tier":"{TASK_TIER}","quota_pct":{session_percent},"quota_adjusted":{true_if_tier_was_downgraded}}'
        ```

     6. Wait for task executor to complete before spawning next task
        (sequential within a plan — tasks may have intra-plan dependencies)

     6. On executor return, check for haiku-tier failure and escalate if needed:
        If the executor's return output contains "TASK FAILED:" AND "[tier: haiku]":
          If quota allows (session_percent < 95, i.e., not in critical conservation):
            Log: "Task {task_index} failed at haiku — re-spawning at sonnet (coordinator escalation)"
            TASK_TIER = "sonnet"
            ROUTING_STATS["haiku"] -= 1  // remove the failed haiku attempt from stats
            ROUTING_STATS["sonnet"] += 1
            Re-spawn the same task using the same executor prompt with TASK_TIER = "sonnet"
            Wait for sonnet executor to complete
          Else (quota critical):
            Log: "Task {task_index} failed at haiku — quota critical, skipping escalation"
            Record task as failed, continue to next task
        If the executor's return output contains "TASK FAILED:" AND tier is NOT haiku (sonnet/opus/unrouted):
          Record task as failed, continue to next task (no escalation for sonnet/opus)
        Escalation only for error/exception failures signaled by the executor.
        Output quality issues do not trigger re-spawn.
   ```

4. **Spot-check result (MANDATORY — do NOT skip):**
   - SUMMARY.md exists for this plan — if missing, the executor failed to complete. HARD FAIL.
   - Git commit present with phase-plan reference
   - No `## Self-Check: FAILED` in SUMMARY.md — if FAILED, HARD FAIL.
   - No `## PLAN FAILED` in executor output — if present, the test gate or tdd task blocked completion. HARD FAIL.
   - If the executor returned a failure message containing "Test gate blocked" or "Test task blocked": do NOT create a SUMMARY.md on the coordinator's behalf. The executor was correct to block. Return the failure to the parent.

5. **Create checkpoint after each wave:**
```json
{
  "phase": {N},
  "step": "execute",
  "wave": {W},
  "plans_complete": [...],
  "plans_remaining": [...],
  "status": "in_progress" | "complete"
}
```

**On plan failure:** Create checkpoint, return failure state to parent coordinator. Do not attempt to continue if a critical dependency plan failed.

**On classifyHandoffIfNeeded error:** Claude Code runtime bug — not a plan failure. Spot-check (SUMMARY.md + commits) to confirm success before treating as failed.
</step>

<checkpoint_ui_qa_loop>

## UI QA Checkpoint Loop

When the executor agent returns a checkpoint message with `Type: ui-qa`, the coordinator runs an automated QA loop before continuing plan execution.

**Trigger:** Executor returns `## CHECKPOINT REACHED` with `Type: ui-qa`.

**Extract from checkpoint message:**
- `what_built`: from the `<what-built>` tag in the checkpoint task
- `test_flows`: from the `<test-flows>` tag in the checkpoint task

**Before the loop: auto-start dev servers via service-health — do NOT ask the user:**

Try the service-health registry first:
```bash
SH_RESULT=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js" service-health start default --raw 2>/dev/null)
SH_STATUS=$(echo "$SH_RESULT" | node -e "try{const r=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin','utf8'));process.stdout.write(r.status||'')}catch{}")
```

- If SH_STATUS is `already_running` or `started`: log "Dev server ready via service-health" and proceed to the QA loop.
- If SH_STATUS is `no_config` or empty (no registry): fall back to inline startup:
  - Check http://localhost:3000 and any other URL mentioned in `what_built`:
    ```bash
    curl -s --max-time 3 http://localhost:3000 > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo UP || echo DOWN
    ```
    If DOWN:
    - NX monorepo (nx.json present): `npx nx dev {app-name}` — app name from `<apps>` tag in checkpoint or infer from CLAUDE.md. Start each app in background.
    - Other: detect from package.json scripts.dev → run in background
    - Wait up to 30s for ready signal. If still DOWN: log warning and proceed.
- If SH_STATUS is `start_timeout`:
  - **DO NOT PROCEED.** Charlotte cannot test a dead server.
  - Read CLAUDE.md for infrastructure startup instructions. Try the startup command found there.
  - If startup still fails after 60s: return a `human-action` checkpoint:
    ```
    ## CHECKPOINT REACHED

    **Type:** human-action
    **Blocked by:** Dev server / infrastructure failed to start for Charlotte QA

    The Charlotte QA checkpoint cannot be skipped or deferred. Please start the dev server manually:
    1. Check CLAUDE.md for the startup command
    2. Verify the server is responding at the expected URL
    3. Reply "continue" once the server is running

    **IMPORTANT:** Charlotte QA CANNOT be deferred to a future phase. It must run before this phase can complete.
    ```
  - Wait for user response. Do NOT mark phase complete without Charlotte QA running.

      You are a senior engineer fixing UI/UX issues found during automated QA testing.

      ## Your task
      Fix the issues listed below. Do not refactor surrounding code. Only fix what is listed.
      Commit each logical fix atomically: `fix([scope]): [what was fixed]`

      ## Codebase context
      Read the project's CLAUDE.md to understand:
      - Project structure and file layout
      - Framework and stack (Next.js, Vite, etc.)
      - Component library (shadcn/ui, MUI, etc.)
      - Code style and patterns

      ## Issues to fix
      {report_markdown}

      ## Investigation approach
      1. Read the full issue report
      2. Group issues by root cause (multiple issues may share one fix)
      3. Prioritize: Critical → High → Medium → Low
      4. Use LSP workspaceSymbol/goToDefinition to locate components before editing
      5. Read files before editing — never edit blind

      ## Common fix patterns
      - Free-text → dropdown: replace `<Input>` with `<Select>` for predefined-value fields
      - Missing loading state: add `isPending` to disable button + show spinner
      - Missing success toast: add `toast.success()` in mutation onSuccess
      - Page crash on undefined: add optional chaining (`?.`) and null guards
      - Breadcrumbs missing: add `<Breadcrumb>` component at top of page
      - Unclickable ID: wrap in `<Link href={...}>` with underline styling
      - Table overflow: wrap in `<div className='overflow-x-auto'>`
      - Navigation broken: check if inside `<form>` element; add `type='button'` to links

      ## After each fix
      - Run type-check: `npx tsc --noEmit` (or project equivalent)
      - Run lint: `npm run lint` (or project equivalent)
      - Commit with format: `fix([scope]): [what was fixed]`

      ## Output when done

  // If Critical/High still present after fix: write UX-ISSUES.md so verifier catches it
  if ux_recheck.severity_counts.critical > 0 OR ux_recheck.severity_counts.high > 0:
    Write `.planning/phases/{phase_dir}/UX-ISSUES.md` with the remaining issues
    Log: "UX issues persist after fix attempt — recorded in UX-ISSUES.md for verifier"

// Write UX audit report to phase directory regardless of outcome
Write `.planning/phases/{phase_dir}/{phase}-{plan}-UX-AUDIT.md` with ux_result.report_markdown (and ux_recheck report if ran)

// Continue plan execution from the next task after the checkpoint:ui-qa task
```

**HARD RULE: The UX audit cannot be skipped when UI tests run.** It runs on the same surface, same service URL, immediately after ui-qa passes. Medium and Low UX issues are logged but do not block execution. Critical and High issues trigger a fix-and-recheck loop.

**Note on commit handling:** The fix subagent commits its own changes atomically per fix. The coordinator does not make additional commits for the QA loop — only the executor's per-task commits and the final summary commit exist.

<detect_web_framework>

## Detect Web Framework

Before running the post-phase UX sweep, detect if this is a web project by checking package.json. This runs unconditionally — regardless of what file extensions appear in SUMMARY.md.

```bash
WEB_FRAMEWORK_DETECTED=false
WEB_FRAMEWORK_NAME=""

if [ -f "package.json" ]; then
  FRAMEWORK=$(node -e "
    try {
      const p = require('./package.json');
      const deps = Object.assign({}, p.dependencies || {}, p.devDependencies || {});
      const frameworks = ['react', 'next', 'vue', 'svelte', '@angular/core', 'nuxt', 'gatsby', 'remix', '@remix-run/react', 'solid-js', 'preact'];
      const found = frameworks.find(function(f) { return deps[f]; });
      console.log(found || '');
    } catch(e) { console.log(''); }
  " 2>/dev/null || echo "")

  if [ -n "$FRAMEWORK" ]; then
    WEB_FRAMEWORK_DETECTED=true
    WEB_FRAMEWORK_NAME="$FRAMEWORK"
    Log: "Web framework detected: ${WEB_FRAMEWORK_NAME} — Charlotte UX sweep will run unconditionally"
  fi
fi
```

If WEB_FRAMEWORK_DETECTED=true: Charlotte UX sweep runs unconditionally for this phase, regardless of whether any .tsx/.jsx files appear in SUMMARY.md. This ensures web projects always get QA coverage.

**HARD RULE: Charlotte UX sweep is MANDATORY for web projects.**

If WEB_FRAMEWORK_DETECTED=true:
- The UX sweep MUST run after all plans complete
- If the dev server fails to start: read CLAUDE.md for startup instructions, attempt startup, then run the sweep
- If after startup attempts the server still won't start: return a `human-action` checkpoint — do NOT skip the sweep
- "The UX was tested by individual checkpoint:ui-qa tasks" is NOT sufficient to skip the end-of-phase sweep
- The sweep catches cross-plan UX regressions and holistic flow issues that per-plan checkpoints miss

There is NO mechanism to skip the Charlotte UX sweep for web projects. The only way to proceed without it is a `human-action` checkpoint where the user explicitly decides.

</detect_web_framework>


<step name="post_phase_ux_sweep">

After ALL plans in this phase have completed execution:

1. Detect if this phase produced web UI. Either condition triggers the sweep:
   a. **Framework detection** (preferred): `WEB_FRAMEWORK_DETECTED=true` from the `detect_web_framework` step above — the project uses a web framework, so ALL phases get a Charlotte sweep regardless of what changed
   b. **SUMMARY.md scan** (fallback): Scan all SUMMARY.md files from this phase for `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.vue`, `.svelte` files in key-files

2. If EITHER condition is true: proceed with Charlotte UX sweep (steps 3-5 below)

3. If web UI was produced:
   a. **Auto-start dev server via service-health** — do NOT ask user:
      ```bash
      SH_RESULT=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js" service-health start default --raw 2>/dev/null)
      SH_STATUS=$(echo "$SH_RESULT" | node -e "try{const r=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin','utf8'));process.stdout.write(r.status||'')}catch{}")
      ```
      If SH_STATUS is `already_running` or `started`: proceed to step b.
      If SH_STATUS is `no_config` or empty: fallback — check http://localhost:3000; if DOWN → NX monorepo → `npx nx dev {app}` in background; other → `npm run dev` in background. Wait up to 30s.
      If SH_STATUS is `start_timeout`: read CLAUDE.md for infrastructure startup instructions, attempt startup. If still failing after 60s: return a `human-action` checkpoint — do NOT skip the sweep. Charlotte cannot test a dead server.
   b. Derive test scope from phase success criteria and SUMMARY.md key-files
   c. Run the Charlotte 3-round loop — mode="ux-audit":
      ```
      Agent(
        subagent_type="gsd-charlotte-qa",
        model="sonnet",
        description="UX audit phase {phase_number}",
        prompt="
          mode=ux-audit
          what_built={phase goal + key UI files from SUMMARYs}
          test_flows={derive from phase success criteria}
          round=1
        "
      )
      ```
   d. If issues found: spawn fix subagent (same as existing ui-qa loop)
   e. Re-run ux-audit after fixes (max 2 fix rounds for UX issues; critical/high blocking)

Note: This runs IN ADDITION to any checkpoint:ui-qa tasks within individual plans.
Those test individual plan scope. This tests the full phase's UI output together.

</step>

<step name="post_phase_e2e">

After post_phase_ux_sweep and before verify_phase_goal:

1. Collect e2e_flows from ALL plan frontmatters in this phase:
   ```bash
   E2E_FLOWS=$(for plan in {phase_dir}/*-PLAN.md; do
     node ~/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js frontmatter get "$plan" --field e2e_flows 2>/dev/null
   done | jq -s 'flatten | unique')
   ```

2. If E2E_FLOWS is empty or null: skip this step.

3. If E2E_FLOWS has entries:
   a. **Auto-start dev server via service-health** — do NOT ask user. Same pattern as post_phase_ux_sweep step 3a — call `service-health start default` first, fall back to inline NX/npm startup if SH_STATUS is `no_config`.
   b. Spawn gsd-charlotte-qa (mode=e2e):
      ```
      Agent(
        subagent_type="gsd-charlotte-qa",
        model="sonnet",
        description="E2E test phase {phase_number}",
        prompt="
          mode=e2e
          e2e_flows={E2E_FLOWS}
          project_dir={project_dir}
          round=1
        "
      )
      ```
   c. Parse results:
      - All flows PASS → log "E2E: {N} flows passing" → continue to verify_phase_goal
      - Any flow FAILS with severity Critical or High → create gap entry → spawn gap closure plan (BLOCKING — do NOT proceed to verify until gaps are closed)
      - Any flow FAILS with severity Medium → create gap entry, record in phase QA report. The verifier will flag this as `gaps_found`. Do NOT silently ignore medium-severity E2E failures.
      - Any flow FAILS with severity Low → log as informational, record in phase QA report. Proceed to verify.

</step>

<step name="verify">
Verify phase goal achieved using VERIFICATION.md:

```bash
node /Users/ollorin/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js init verify-work {phase_number}
```

**HARD RULE: The coordinator MUST spawn gsd-verifier to write VERIFICATION.md.**

Writing VERIFICATION.md inline (coordinator writes it directly without spawning gsd-verifier) is prohibited for phases that:
- Contain any .tsx/.jsx files in their SUMMARY.md key-files
- Have any PLAN.md with a checkpoint:ui-qa task
- Have success criteria mentioning "Charlotte", "browser QA", "UI test", or "integration test"

If the coordinator DOES write inline (e.g., timeout fallback), it MUST set `verifier: coordinator` in the frontmatter. When gsd-verifier runs in re-verification mode and sees `verifier: coordinator`, it MUST re-run all QA-related QGATEs (07, 10, 12) regardless of what the coordinator's inline report said.

Spawn verifier agent to create VERIFICATION.md:
```
// Pick verifier tier based on phase complexity
MUST_HAVES_COUNT = sum of (must_haves.truths.length + must_haves.artifacts.length) across all PLAN.md files in {phase_dir}
VERIFIER_MODEL = MUST_HAVES_COUNT >= 8 ? "opus" : "sonnet"

Agent(
  subagent_type="gsd-verifier",
  model={VERIFIER_MODEL},
  description="Verify phase {phase_number}",
  prompt="Verify phase {phase_number} goal achievement.
Phase directory: {phase_dir}
Phase goal: {goal from ROADMAP.md}
Check must_haves against actual codebase. Create VERIFICATION.md."
)
```

Read verification result:
```bash
grep "^status:" .planning/phases/{phase_dir}/*-VERIFICATION.md
```

**HARD RULE: VERIFICATION.md must exist on disk before phase can return any success state.**

```bash
VERIFICATION_EXISTS=$(ls .planning/phases/{phase_dir}/*-VERIFICATION.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
if [ "$VERIFICATION_EXISTS" = "0" ]; then
  # Verifier was spawned but failed to write VERIFICATION.md — HARD FAIL
  Log: "CRITICAL: gsd-verifier completed but no VERIFICATION.md found on disk"
  Return: { "status": "failed", "step": "verify", "reason": "Verifier completed but did not write VERIFICATION.md — phase cannot be marked complete without verification" }
fi
```

**Status routing:**
- `passed` → send phase_complete notification, then return success state
- `gaps_found` → return gaps_found state with details from VERIFICATION.md
- `human_needed` → return human_needed state with items requiring human testing

**Notification 5 — Phase complete** (fires when verification status is "passed"):

```
if telegram_topic_id is not null:
  duration_minutes = calculate from phase start timestamp to now (round to nearest minute)

  // Build routing stats string if per-task routing was used
  routing_stats_str = ""
  if PER_TASK_MODE and ROUTING_STATS is non-empty:
    parts = []
    if ROUTING_STATS.haiku > 0: parts.push("{ROUTING_STATS.haiku} haiku")
    if ROUTING_STATS.sonnet > 0: parts.push("{ROUTING_STATS.sonnet} sonnet")
    if ROUTING_STATS.opus > 0: parts.push("{ROUTING_STATS.opus} opus")
    routing_stats_str = " | " + parts.join(" / ")

  mcp__telegram__send_message({
    text: "Phase {phase_number} complete ({duration_minutes}m) — {phase_name}{routing_stats_str}",
    ...(telegram_topic_id ? { thread_id: telegram_topic_id } : {})
  })
  // JSONL: {"type":"notification","event":"phase_complete","timestamp":"{ISO}","phase":{N},"duration_minutes":{N}}
  // Append above line to .planning/telegram-sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}.jsonl
```

**Create final checkpoint:**
```json
{
  "phase": {N},
  "step": "verify",
  "status": "passed" | "gaps_found" | "human_needed",
  "verification_path": "..."
}
```
</step>

<step name="cross_phase_integration">

After verify_phase_goal, check for cross-phase integration boundaries.

**Trigger conditions (ANY of these triggers integration testing — not just explicit depends_on):**

1. **Explicit dependency:** Current phase `depends_on` has entries in ROADMAP.md
2. **Shared artifact detection:** Current phase's SUMMARY.md key-files overlap with any previous phase's SUMMARY.md key-files (same API routes, same database tables, same shared components)
3. **API producer/consumer:** Current phase creates or modifies API routes that are called by components from previous phases, OR current phase creates components that call API routes from previous phases

```bash
# Check explicit depends_on
DEPENDS_ON=$(node ~/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js roadmap get-phase {phase_number} --raw 2>/dev/null | node -e "try{const d=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin','utf8'));console.log(JSON.stringify(d.depends_on||[]))}catch{console.log('[]')}" 2>/dev/null || echo "[]")

# Check for shared files with ANY completed phase (not just depends_on)
CURRENT_FILES=$(grep -oE '[\w\-\/\.]+\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)' .planning/phases/{phase_dir}/*-SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null | sort -u)
SHARED_OVERLAP=false
for prev_phase_dir in .planning/phases/*/; do
  if [ "$prev_phase_dir" != ".planning/phases/{phase_dir}/" ] && ls "$prev_phase_dir"*-SUMMARY.md >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    PREV_FILES=$(grep -oE '[\w\-\/\.]+\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)' "$prev_phase_dir"*-SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null | sort -u)
    OVERLAP=$(comm -12 <(echo "$CURRENT_FILES") <(echo "$PREV_FILES") 2>/dev/null)
    if [ -n "$OVERLAP" ]; then
      SHARED_OVERLAP=true
      OVERLAPPING_PHASE="$prev_phase_dir"
      break
    fi
  fi
done
```

**If DEPENDS_ON is non-empty OR SHARED_OVERLAP is true:**

1. Read SUMMARY.md of each depended-on phase AND any overlapping phase — collect exported artifacts
2. Read SUMMARY.md of current phase — collect consumed artifacts
3. If overlap found (same API routes, same tables, same component names):

   Spawn gsd-integration-tester:
   ```
   Agent(
     subagent_type="gsd-integration-tester",
     model="sonnet",
     description="Integration test phase {phase_number}",
     prompt="
       current_phase={phase_slug}
       depends_on_phases={depends_on list + overlapping phases}
       integration_points={derived overlap}
       project_dir={project_dir}
     "
   )
   ```

4. If blocking mismatches found: create gap closure plans (same pattern as verification gaps). This is a HARD BLOCK — do NOT proceed to phase complete with blocking integration mismatches.

</step>

</execution_cycle>

<checkpoint_protocol>
After each step (discuss, research, plan, execute, verify):

1. Write checkpoint to `.planning/phases/{phase_dir}/CHECKPOINT.json`:
```json
{
  "phase": {N},
  "phase_name": "...",
  "last_step": "discuss|research|plan|execute|verify",
  "step_status": "complete|skipped|gray_areas_identified|failed",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "files_touched": [...],
  "key_context": "...",
  "resume_from": "discuss|research|plan|execute|verify|done"
}
```

2. Log to EXECUTION_LOG.md via gsd-tools if available

3. Overwrite previous checkpoint (only latest matters for resume)

**Purpose:** Enable resume from any step on failure. Parent coordinator reads checkpoint to understand where to restart.

**CHECKPOINT.json field semantics (authoritative contract):**

- `step_status: "complete"` — the step RAN to completion. This does NOT mean the phase goal was achieved. For the `verify` step, "complete" only means the verifier agent ran and wrote VERIFICATION.md — the actual outcome is in VERIFICATION.md's `status` field.
- `step_status: "skipped"` — the step was not needed (e.g., CONTEXT.md already existed, so discuss was skipped).
- `step_status: "failed"` — the step encountered an error before completing.
- `last_step` — the most recent step that ran. `last_step: "verify"` means the verify step ran (not that it passed).
- `resume_from` — which step a restarted coordinator should begin from.

**Outcome authority:** VERIFICATION.md `status` is the authoritative judgment on whether the phase achieved its goal. CHECKPOINT.json only tracks execution lifecycle (what ran), not quality outcome (did it succeed). A coordinator MUST NOT mark a phase as roadmap-complete based on CHECKPOINT.json alone — it must read VERIFICATION.md `status: "passed"`.

**Invariant enforced by tooling:** `gsd-tools.js phase complete` refuses to mark a phase done unless VERIFICATION.md has `status: "passed"`, all PLAN.md files have matching SUMMARY.md files, and CHECKPOINT.json has `last_step: "verify"`. This contract is not advisory — it is a hard gate.
</checkpoint_protocol>

<return_state>
**HARD RULE: Status "completed" requires VERIFICATION.md with status "passed".**

Before returning ANY response with `status: "completed"`:
1. Verify VERIFICATION.md exists on disk
2. Verify VERIFICATION.md `status` field is "passed"
3. If either check fails → return `status: "gaps_found"` or `status: "failed"` instead

A phase is NEVER "completed" without passing verification. There is no shortcut, no fallback, no "the executor said it was done so it must be done" path.

Return structured JSON as final response:

```json
{
  "phase": 6,
  "phase_name": "autonomous-execution-core",
  "status": "completed | failed | blocked | gaps_found | human_needed",
  "steps_completed": ["discuss", "research", "plan", "execute", "verify"],
  "checkpoints": [
    { "step": "discuss", "status": "skipped" },
    { "step": "research", "status": "skipped" },
    { "step": "plan", "status": "skipped" },
    { "step": "execute", "status": "complete", "plans_count": 4 },
    { "step": "verify", "status": "passed" }
  ],
  "files_modified": ["path/to/file.js", ...],
  "error": null,
  "gaps": null,
  "human_items": null,
  "duration_minutes": 12
}
```

**On failure:**
```json
{
  "phase": 6,
  "status": "failed",
  "steps_completed": ["research", "plan"],
  "error": "Plan 06-03 executor failed: ...",
  "checkpoints": [...],
  "files_modified": [...],
  "resume_from": "execute"
}
```
</return_state>

<error_handling>
- **Research fails:** Log error, return `{ status: "failed", step: "research" }` — don't attempt plan/execute/verify
- **Planning fails:** Log error, return `{ status: "failed", step: "plan" }` — don't attempt execute/verify
- **Single plan fails:** Create checkpoint, continue with remaining plans in wave — aggregate failures
- **All plans fail:** Return `{ status: "failed", step: "execute" }` immediately
- **Verification gaps:** Return `{ status: "gaps_found", gaps: [...] }` — parent offers gap closure
- **Human verification needed:** Return `{ status: "human_needed", human_items: [...] }` — parent presents to user

**Notification 6 — Phase failure** (fires for every failed/blocked outcome before returning failure state):

```
if telegram_topic_id is not null:
  mcp__telegram__send_message({
    text: "Phase {phase_number} failed at {step} step\n\nError: {error}\n\nOptions: reply 'retry', 'skip', or 'stop'",
    ...(telegram_topic_id ? { thread_id: telegram_topic_id } : {})
  })
  // JSONL: {"type":"notification","event":"phase_failed","timestamp":"{ISO}","phase":{N},"step":"{step}","error":"{error}"}
  // Append above line to .planning/telegram-sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}.jsonl
```

Note: The failure notification in execute-roadmap.md handles roadmap-level failure reporting. This notification (Notification 6) is the phase-level failure report. Both can coexist — they fire in different contexts (phase coordinator vs roadmap coordinator).
</error_handling>
