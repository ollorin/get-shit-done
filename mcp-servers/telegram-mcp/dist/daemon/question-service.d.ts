/**
 * Question lifecycle management for the Telegram MCP daemon.
 *
 * QuestionService manages the full lifecycle of blocking questions:
 *   1. Creates a Telegram forum thread for each new question
 *   2. Posts the question body to the thread
 *   3. Blocks the caller (via Promise + EventEmitter) until the user replies
 *   4. Routes incoming thread replies to the waiting promise via deliverAnswer()
 *
 * Follow-up questions: If a session has a recently answered question (within
 * the last 5 minutes), new questions reuse that thread instead of creating a
 * new topic — keeping conversations in one place per user decision.
 *
 * Fallback: If createForumTopic fails (group not configured, bot not admin),
 * the question falls back to DM mode — text sent to TELEGRAM_OWNER_ID with
 * no thread tracking.
 *
 * Events emitted:
 *   `answer:${questionId}` (answer: string) — when a user answer arrives
 *   `anyAnswer` () — broadcast when any answer arrives (for long-poll wakeup)
