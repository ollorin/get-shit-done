## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initial roadmap: 8-phase structure with Auto Mode first, then Knowledge, then Autonomous Execution
- Sequence: Auto Mode (1-2) → Knowledge (3-5) → Autonomous (6-7) → Integration (8)
- Phase sizing: 3-5 plans per phase target to avoid context exhaustion
- Parallel execution: Phases 1-2 can run parallel to Phase 3
- [Phase 01]: Use comma-separated patterns in markdown tables instead of pipe-separated to avoid delimiter conflicts
- [Phase 01]: Routing rules: project rules override global rules for same patterns
- [Phase 01-02]: Use simple keyword extraction with stop words instead of NLP library for speed
- [Phase 01-02]: Cache context index for 1 hour to avoid rebuilding on every routing call
- [Phase 01-02]: Weight tag matches 2x higher than keyword matches for scoring
- [Phase 01-02]: Extract CLAUDE.md instructions via pattern matching (bullet/numbered lists)
- [Phase 01-03]: 80% soft warning threshold (shows once per session, non-blocking)
- [Phase 01-03]: 98% hard threshold triggers auto-wait calculation
- [Phase 01-03]: Auto-wait returns duration info for coordinator to handle (not blocking in CLI)
- [Phase 01-03]: Both session and weekly quotas tracked independently
- [Phase 01-04]: Status bar shows: total tokens, last model, time saved, model distribution
- [Phase 01-04]: Stats command calculates cost savings vs hypothetical all-Opus execution
- [Phase 01-04]: Both table (human-readable) and JSON (programmatic) output formats
- [Phase 01-04]: Quota functions integrated into project gsd-tools.js for consistency
- [Phase 01-05]: Use 11 categories to organize routing rules (Testing, Architecture, Implementation, Debugging, Analysis, Refactoring, Security, DevOps, Documentation, Research, Performance)
- [Phase 01-05]: Extract high-level patterns from session logs rather than project-specific patterns
- [Phase 01-05]: Use action verbs with scope modifiers to capture intent and complexity level
- [Phase 01-06]: Escalation ladder: Haiku (20min) → Sonnet (40min) → Opus (60min) before failure
- [Phase 01-06]: Log both fallbacks and matches for comprehensive routing analytics
- [Phase 01-06]: Fallback to Sonnet when routing fails rather than blocking execution
- [Phase 02-01]: Mock validation for infrastructure testing; live Sonnet API integration deferred to execute-plan workflow
- [Phase 02-01]: Three validation depths: light (docs/low-risk), standard (API/config), thorough (auth/security/database)
- [Phase 02-01]: Auto-retry triggers on REDO or FIX with scores < 70
- [Phase 02-01]: JSONL format for validation log enables streaming append and easy analytics
- [Phase 02-02]: Iteration caps (15-20 steps) have HIGHER priority than time limits for execution safety
- [Phase 02-02]: Model-specific timeouts: 20m Haiku, 40m Sonnet, 60m Opus
- [Phase 02-02]: Complexity keywords trigger 1.5x multiplier for task limits
- [Phase 02-02]: Learned multipliers stored in thresholds.json for pattern-based adjustment
- [Phase 02-03]: Weighted error scoring: COMPLETE_REJECTION=1.0, VALIDATION_FIX=0.5, RETRY=0.25
- [Phase 02-03]: Aggressive escalation threshold of 1.0 (1-2 errors trigger escalation)
- [Phase 02-03]: Escalation ladder: haiku → sonnet → opus → null
- [Phase 02-03]: Summary notification at end only (no inline interruptions)
- [Phase 02-03]: JSONL format for escalation log enables streaming and analytics
- [Phase 02-04]: Feedback disabled by default (optional feature flag)
- [Phase 02-04]: Support both human and Opus modes (configurable)
- [Phase 02-04]: Three frequency modes: all, escalations, sample
- [Phase 02-04]: JSONL format for feedback log enables streaming append and easy analytics
- [Phase 02-04]: Task fingerprinting with multi-signal complexity detection (keywords, technical terms, complexity)
- [Phase 02-05]: Multi-signal pattern extraction combines keywords with complexity signals
- [Phase 02-05]: Keyword overlap >50% threshold for pattern consolidation
- [Phase 02-05]: Evidence threshold of 3 feedback entries required to override built-in rules
- [Phase 02-05]: Learned rules in human-readable markdown for transparency and user editing
- [Phase 02-05]: All conflict resolution decisions logged to rule-merge-log.jsonl
- [Phase 02-06]: Execute-plan workflow documents Phase 2 safety integration (validation, circuit-breaker, escalation, feedback)
- [Phase 02-06]: Auto-task orchestration commands provide single entry point for Phase 2 system status and reporting
- [Phase 02-06]: End-of-execution report aggregates validation stats, escalation history, and feedback summary
- [Phase 02-06]: All five Phase 2 modules integrated and tested end-to-end
- [Phase 03-01]: Use WAL mode for better concurrency in knowledge operations
- [Phase 03-01]: Cache database connections per path to avoid repeated opens
- [Phase 03-01]: Gracefully degrade when sqlite-vec unavailable (FTS5 still works)
- [Phase 03-01]: Store per-user databases using OS username
- [Phase 03-01]: PRAGMA user_version for schema migration tracking
