# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-19)

**Core value:** Claude learns to make autonomous decisions based on user's reasoning patterns, only stopping for irreversible/external/costly actions
**Current focus:** v1.11.0 — System Hardening (Phase 30 complete — milestone done)

## Current Position

Phase: 31-per-task-model-routing-executor-becomes-mini-orchestrator-option-a (in progress)
Plan: 3 of ? (31-02 and 31-03 complete)
Status: Plan 31-02 complete — per-task tier routing and quota downgrade added to coordinator execute step
Last activity: 2026-02-20 — Plan 31-02 complete (PER_TASK_MODE, TASK_TIERS, quota downgrade, haiku escalation, routing stats in Telegram notification)

Progress: [████████████████████] 100% (v1.11.0 — 5/5 phases, Phase 31 in progress)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 108 (v1.9.0: 85, v1.9.1: 5, v1.10.0: 10, v1.11.0: 8)
- Average duration: 3.0 min
- Total execution time: ~4.9 hours

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 20]: Enabled branching_strategy=phase — gsd/phase-N-slug branches at phase start
- [Phase 20]: Fixed findPhaseInternal bug — phase-N-name directory format now recognized
- [Phase 20]: Auto-routing lives in gsd-phase-coordinator.md (not execute-phase.md) — confirmed intact
- [v1.10.0 roadmap]: NOTIF-01 (create_topic MCP tool) assigned to Phase 24 — can run after DISC framework exists; no value in splitting it earlier
- [Phase 21-01]: getDBPath('project') now resolves to global path — 'scope' column is metadata only
- [Phase 21-01]: getDBPath('legacy') added for migrate-knowledge command only, not general use
- [Phase 21-01]: Old per-project DBs NOT auto-deleted by migrate-knowledge — user deletes manually
- [Phase 21-01]: Migrated entries left with null project_slug (untagged — acceptable per locked decision)
- [Phase 21-02]: resolveProjectSlug() uses config.json project.slug → path.basename(cwd) fallback — no mandatory config required
- [Phase 21-02]: CLI flag is --project (not --project-slug) to avoid confusion with existing --scope flag
- [Phase 21-03]: getConversationAnalysisLogPath() updated to ~/.claude/knowledge/ (global) matching Plan 01 migration
- [Phase 21-03]: Slug reversal lossy but acceptable — reverseSlugToCwd() only used for .planning/ existence check
- [Phase 21-03]: query-knowledge top 5 results, no confidence threshold filtering (per locked decision)
- [Phase 22-01]: discuss step uses ls *-CONTEXT.md glob check (not gsd-tools) — consistent with existing research/plan skip guards
- [Phase 22-01]: gray_areas_identified is intermediate checkpoint status — full complete status deferred to Plan 22-04 when CONTEXT.md written
- [Phase 22-01]: Gray areas must be concretely named — examples provided inline in step body to prevent generic labels
- [Phase 22-03]: gsd-meta-answerer synthesizes top-5 results rather than returning first result verbatim — prevents echo-chamber answers
- [Phase 22-03]: Confidence bumps (+0.05 each) for source_type=decision and matching project_slug — explicit decisions and same-project knowledge rank higher
- [Phase 22-03]: Per-question error isolation: failed queries produce marked entries (error field) and batch continues — no partial batch abandonment
- [Phase 22-02]: Question generation runs inline in coordinator (no subagent spawn) — simple reasoning task, avoids coordination overhead
- [Phase 22-02]: 3 specificity levels (high/mid/low) per gray area — covers approach, parameters, and edge cases
- [Phase 22-02]: questions_generated replaces gray_areas_identified as checkpoint status — single intermediate status covering both steps
- [Phase 22-04]: Confidence threshold 0.7 fixed (not configurable) — matches locked decision from Phase 22-03 bump rules
- [Phase 22-04]: questions_generated checkpoint fires before meta-answerer spawn — preserves intermediate state on spawn failure
- [Phase 22-04]: needs-escalation items logged but do not block in Phase 22 — {ESCALATION} placeholder marks Phase 23 insertion point
- [Phase 22-04]: Claude's Discretion subsection populated from needs-escalation items with confidence >= 0.4 — captures recoverable gaps
- [Phase 23-01]: Sensitivity filter gates Telegram escalation — only items matching at least 1 of 6 criteria are escalated; non-sensitive items remain in Claude's Discretion
- [Phase 23-01]: ask_blocking_question called per-item (not batched) — each question gets a focused reply before processing the next
- [Phase 23-01]: Session status lifecycle (waiting/busy) wraps each blocking call — provides real-time feedback in Telegram session UI
- [Phase 23-01]: Human replies stored with confidence 1.0 (authoritative) and merged into sufficient_answers before CONTEXT.md write
- [Phase 23-01]: CONTEXT.md Escalated Decisions subsection added when escalated_answers.length > 0; footer stat includes Escalated count
- [Phase 23-02]: Multi-turn loop max_turns = 3 (not configurable) — matches locked confidence threshold approach
- [Phase 23-02]: Reply confidence evaluated inline: 0.85 (clear actionable), 0.65 (general direction), 0.5 (non-committal)
- [Phase 23-02]: Session status (waiting/busy) toggled once per item outside loop — not per turn to avoid excessive API churn
- [Phase 23-02]: JSONL entries use date-based file .planning/telegram-sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}.jsonl — consistent with existing session format
- [Phase 24-01]: create_topic returns { threadId } verbatim — no extraction needed (adapter JSON.stringify path handles it, unlike ask_blocking_question which extracts .answer)
- [Phase 24-01]: Daemon guard reuses same pattern as send_message: checks questionService null (bot not available) rather than a separate bot check
- [Phase 24-telegram-notifications]: execute-roadmap creates forum topic at execution start (non-fatal — null-guards all send_message calls if Telegram unavailable)
- [Phase 24-03]: telegram_topic_id initialized from prompt at top of execution_cycle — single initialization point, all steps inherit it
- [Phase 24-03]: update_session_status calls intentionally excluded from thread_id wiring — daemon-level bookkeeping, no thread_id field on that tool
- [Phase 24-03]: ask_blocking_question left unchanged — creates its own reply thread, not a forum notification
- [Phase 24-03]: Parent spawn convention is prompt string injection: "telegram_topic_id: {value}" or "telegram_topic_id: null"
- [Phase 24-04]: Phase start notification fires before discuss step check — captures every phase entry even if CONTEXT.md already exists
- [Phase 24-04]: context_ready fires on both CONTEXT.md skip path (distinct message) and run path (with counts)
- [Phase 24-04]: research_done and plans_ready notifications only fire for 'complete' status — skip paths are silent (no noise)
- [Phase 24-04]: phase_complete includes duration_minutes calculated from phase start timestamp — key UX metric
- [Phase 24-04]: phase_failed fires for all failed/blocked outcomes with retry/skip/stop options — actionable recovery prompt
- [Phase 24-04]: Coordinator failure notification coexists with execute-roadmap failure notification — different scopes (phase-level vs roadmap-level)
- [Phase 25-02]: Phase 26 gray area C (distribution: commit vs Telegram vs private) is the escalation target — matches sensitivity criterion #3 (major architectural decision on output visibility), guarantees escalation in live validation
- [Phase 25-02]: Test fixture design pattern — inject phase with known confidence profile into ROADMAP.md rather than running discuss step against real upcoming phase (avoids polluting actual planning with synthetic gray areas)
- [Phase 25-03]: Milestone summary keep locally (gitignored), not committed to repo — user's explicit Telegram reply
- [Phase 25-03]: Telegram daemon polling fix: bot.launch() must not be awaited in Telegraf v4 long polling mode — fire-and-forget
- [Phase 25-03]: Gray Area C (distribution visibility) correctly triggered Criterion 3 sensitivity escalation — test fixture design confirmed correct
- [Phase 25-03]: CONTEXT.md footer stat labels fixed: KB answers / Claude's Discretion / Escalated (not 'Autonomous answers / Needs escalation')
- [Phase 25]: Test phase (26) used gray areas around milestone summary storage and distribution — calibrated for mixed autonomous/escalated discuss step output
- [Phase 25]: Phase 26 stub added to ROADMAP.md as "Milestone Summary & Archival" for future milestone (v1.11.0)
- [Phase 25]: End-to-end validation passed — full discuss loop verified working (27 questions, 26 autonomous, 1 Telegram escalated and replied)
- [Phase 27-01]: Stage-3 embedding dedup lazy-required inside loop (not at module import) — avoids ML model init at session start
- [Phase 27-01]: 2s Promise.race timeout — balances dedup quality vs write latency; subsequent calls hit in-memory cache
- [Phase 27-02]: Meta-answerer multi-pass: 0.5 cap (Pass 2 decision type), 0.4 cap (Pass 3 keyword broadening) — reflects diminished evidence quality
- [Phase 27-03]: knowledge prune CLI scope default is 'global' — DB is global, pruning 'project' scope would be a wrong default
- [Phase 27-03]: Auto-prune trigger in createCheckpoint (not knowledge.add) — lower frequency write point with available connection object
- [Phase 28-01]: appendMetrics() uses fs.appendFileSync wrapped in try/catch — metrics write failure must not affect hook output
- [Phase 28-02]: estimateTokens = Math.ceil(length / 4) — standard GPT token approximation; fields named originalTokensEst/compressedTokensEst (not originalTokens/compressedTokens) to match what CLI already expected
- [Phase 28-03]: selectiveExtract falls back to first-N-chars when queryContext empty — zero behavioral change for existing callers; queryContext sourced from hookData.context || hookData.query_context
- [Phase 29-01]: Stop hook (not SIGTERM) is the correct Claude Code lifecycle hook for session-end extraction — fires after each assistant turn, not just at session end
- [Phase 29-01]: Temp file /tmp/gsd-session-{session_id}.txt accumulates responses across turns; extraction runs on full accumulated text each call; dedup prevents duplicate DB entries
- [Phase 29-01]: stop_hook_active guard required on all Stop hooks to prevent infinite loop (Claude Code sets this when already continuing from a stop hook)
- [Phase 29-01]: better-sqlite3 and sqlite-vec added to installHookDependencies() — required for knowledge DB access from deployed ~/.claude/get-shit-done/ location
- [Phase 30-01]: milestone summarize reads title/duration from SUMMARY.md frontmatter, falls back to first H2 heading for phases without title field
- [Phase 30-01]: milestone archive-phases uses fs.renameSync (move, not copy) per ARCH-02 spec; idempotency via fs.existsSync check before move
- [Phase 30-01]: Phase completeness check for archival = presence of VERIFICATION.md (not all plans have SUMMARY.md)
- [Phase 30-01]: milestone summarize overwrites existing summary (idempotent); milestone archive-phases skips already-archived phases
- [Phase 31-per-task-model-routing-executor-becomes-mini-orchestrator-option-a]: Executor does NOT switch tiers mid-execution — model tier is fixed at spawn time; coordinator owns escalation decision to re-spawn at sonnet
- [Phase 31-per-task-model-routing-executor-becomes-mini-orchestrator-option-a]: Haiku failure signal format: 'TASK FAILED: {name} [tier: haiku] — {error}'; sonnet/opus failures use existing behavior (no tier tag)
- [Phase 31-01]: routing_pass step fires after write_phase_prompt and before validate_plan in gsd-planner — tier tags committed with plan
- [Phase 31-01]: MODEL_PROFILE check fail = silent skip (routing is best-effort); per-task router failure defaults to sonnet
- [Phase 31]: PER_TASK_MODE activates only when at least one task has an explicit tier tag — backward-compatible fallback to plan-level routing for plans with no tier tags
