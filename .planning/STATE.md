# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-15)

**Core value:** Claude learns to make autonomous decisions based on user's reasoning patterns, only stopping for irreversible/external/costly actions
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Auto Mode Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Auto Mode Foundation)
Plan: 04 of 06 (Multiple plans complete)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-15 — Completed plan 01-04 (auto profile and usage display)

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 40%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: 0.3 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total  | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|
| 01    | 4     | 17 min | 4 min    |

**Recent Completions:**

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 01    | 01   | 4 min    | 3     | 4     |
| 01    | 02   | 4 min    | 3     | 3     |
| 01    | 03   | 4 min    | 3     | 2     |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initial roadmap: 8-phase structure with Auto Mode first, then Knowledge, then Autonomous Execution
- Sequence: Auto Mode (1-2) → Knowledge (3-5) → Autonomous (6-7) → Integration (8)
- Phase sizing: 3-5 plans per phase target to avoid context exhaustion
- Parallel execution: Phases 1-2 can run parallel to Phase 3
- [Phase 01]: Use comma-separated patterns in markdown tables instead of pipe-separated to avoid delimiter conflicts
- [Phase 01]: Routing rules: project rules override global rules for same patterns
- [Phase 01-02]: Use simple keyword extraction with stop words instead of NLP library for speed
- [Phase 01-02]: Cache context index for 1 hour to avoid rebuilding on every routing call
- [Phase 01-02]: Weight tag matches 2x higher than keyword matches for scoring
- [Phase 01-02]: Extract CLAUDE.md instructions via pattern matching (bullet/numbered lists)
- [Phase 01-03]: 80% soft warning threshold (shows once per session, non-blocking)
- [Phase 01-03]: 98% hard threshold triggers auto-wait calculation
- [Phase 01-03]: Auto-wait returns duration info for coordinator to handle (not blocking in CLI)
- [Phase 01-03]: Both session and weekly quotas tracked independently
- [Phase 01-04]: Status bar shows: total tokens, last model, time saved, model distribution
- [Phase 01-04]: Stats command calculates cost savings vs hypothetical all-Opus execution
- [Phase 01-04]: Both table (human-readable) and JSON (programmatic) output formats
- [Phase 01-04]: Quota functions integrated into project gsd-tools.js for consistency
