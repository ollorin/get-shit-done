<summary>✅ v1.9.1 Upstream Sync (Phases 18-20) — COMPLETE 2026-02-19</summary>

**Milestone Goal:** Review glittercowboy/get-shit-done upstream commits and port the most valuable improvements into this fork without breaking fork-specific features (auto routing, knowledge system, Telegram MCP, autonomous execution).

#### Phase 18: Upstream Audit — COMPLETE
**Goal**: Developer can see exactly what upstream has added since the fork diverged, with every change categorized and evaluated for portability
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of milestone)
**Requirements**: AUDT-01, AUDT-02
**Plans**: 1/1

Plans:
- [x] 18-01: Fetch upstream, compare commit history, produce UPSTREAM-DIFF.md — completed 2026-02-19

#### Phase 19: Bug Fixes & Context Window Management — COMPLETE
**Goal**: All upstream stability fixes and context window improvements are running in the fork with no regressions to existing fork-specific features
**Depends on**: Phase 18
**Requirements**: BUGF-01, BUGF-02, CTXT-01
**Plans**: 2/2

Plans:
- [x] 19-01: Port upstream bug fixes to shared code paths — completed 2026-02-19
- [x] 19-02: Port upstream context window management improvements — completed 2026-02-19

#### Phase 20: Git Branching & Autonomous Execution — COMPLETE
**Goal**: GSD creates feature branches at phase start and any compatible upstream execution improvements are integrated without breaking the fork's sub-coordinator design
**Depends on**: Phase 19
**Requirements**: GIT-01, GIT-02, EXEC-01, EXEC-02
**Plans**: 2/2

Plans:
- [x] 20-01: Implement early git branching at phase start — completed 2026-02-19
- [x] 20-02: Port compatible upstream autonomous execution improvements — completed 2026-02-19
