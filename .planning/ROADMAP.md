# Roadmap: GSD Enhancements v2.0

## Overview

This roadmap transforms GSD from a phase-based development framework into an intelligent, autonomous system that learns user preferences and executes entire projects with minimal intervention. The journey begins with Auto Mode (intelligent model selection for 40-60% token savings), builds knowledge persistence using SQLite + sqlite-vec with multi-phase search and memory evolution (synthesizing omega-memory patterns), then culminates in autonomous multi-phase roadmap execution with structured checkpoints and fresh context per phase. Integration touchpoints (Telegram notifications, observability) enable production-ready deployment with cost controls and progress tracking.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Auto Mode Foundation
**Goal**: Users can execute GSD commands with `/gsd:set-profile auto` and see 40-60% token savings through intelligent model selection without quality loss
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: AUTO-01, AUTO-02, AUTO-03, AUTO-04, AUTO-07, AUTO-08, AUTO-09, AUTO-10
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. System detects task complexity via multi-signal analysis and maps to model tiers (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)
  2. Users can set profile to 'auto' and commands route to appropriate model automatically
  3. Token and cost tracking displays per-task metrics and cumulative savings vs manual profiles
  4. Quota tracking prevents exceeding session/weekly limits by adjusting model selection
  5. Default behavior uses Sonnet when complexity unclear or detection fails
**Plans:** 6 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 01-01-PLAN.md - Routing rules infrastructure (pattern table, parser, merge logic)
- [ ] 01-02-PLAN.md - Task context skill (model + context injection)
- [ ] 01-03-PLAN.md - Quota and token tracking with auto-wait
- [ ] 01-04-PLAN.md - Auto profile and status display
- [ ] 01-05-PLAN.md - Session scanning for rule bootstrap (checkpoint)
- [ ] 01-06-PLAN.md - Execute-plan integration and fallback behavior

### Phase 2: Auto Mode Refinement
**Goal**: Auto mode operates safely with circuit breakers preventing runaway execution and learns from user feedback to improve routing accuracy
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: AUTO-05, AUTO-06, AUTO-11, AUTO-12, AUTO-13, AUTO-14
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Haiku-executed tasks are validated by Sonnet before marking complete
  2. Failed Haiku validations trigger automatic re-execution with Sonnet
  3. Hard iteration caps (15-20 steps) and global timeouts (60-120 sec) prevent infinite loops
  4. Error rate thresholds automatically escalate to stronger models
  5. Users can mark incorrect model choices and system learns to improve future routing
**Plans:** 6 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 02-01-PLAN.md - Validation infrastructure (LLM-as-a-judge, two-stage checking)
- [ ] 02-02-PLAN.md - Circuit breakers (opossum, iteration caps, adaptive thresholds)
- [ ] 02-03-PLAN.md - Error escalation (weighted scoring, escalation ladder)

- [ ] 02-05-PLAN.md - Learning system (pattern extraction, rule merging)
- [ ] 02-06-PLAN.md - Execute-plan integration (safety mechanisms)

### Phase 3: Knowledge System Foundation
**Goal**: GSD maintains local knowledge databases (global and project-scoped) using SQLite + sqlite-vec with multi-phase search, type-weighted scoring, TTL-based lifecycle management, and access tracking for relevance ranking
**Depends on**: Nothing (parallel to Phase 1-2)
**Requirements**: KNOW-01, KNOW-02, KNOW-03, KNOW-04, KNOW-05, KNOW-06, KNOW-07, KNOW-08, KNOW-09, KNOW-10, KNOW-11
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Local database using SQLite + sqlite-vec (better-sqlite3) stores knowledge with vector + FTS5 search
  2. Multi-phase search pipeline: vector similarity, FTS5 text fallback, type weights, context boost
  3. Type-weighted scoring ranks decisions/lessons at 2.0x, summaries at 0.5x
  4. TTL categories manage memory lifecycle (permanent: lessons, long-term: decisions, short-term: summaries)
  5. Automatic cleanup removes expired memories based on TTL without manual intervention
  6. Access tracking (access_count, last_accessed) boosts frequently-used knowledge in search
  7. Global scope at ~/.claude/knowledge/, project scope at .planning/knowledge/
  8. System works without knowledge DB (fallback to current GSD behavior)
  9. Multi-user support via separate files per developer prevents merge conflicts
**Plans:** 5 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 03-01-PLAN.md - Database infrastructure (SQLite + sqlite-vec setup, schema, migrations)

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Claude hooks capture conversation context using regex patterns (decisions: "let's use", "decided to"; lessons: "turns out", "I learned")
  2. Quality gates prevent noise (min 20 chars, tech signal detection like `/`, backticks, "error")
  3. Per-turn mode analyzes after each response; session-end mode batches at end
  4. Hooks configurable: enable/disable, switch timing modes
  5. On-the-fly extraction captures decisions during GSD flows without blocking execution
  6. Three-stage deduplication: content hash, canonical hash, embedding similarity (0.88 threshold)
  7. Memory evolution: similarity 0.65-0.88 updates existing memory instead of creating duplicate
  8. Q&A sessions enable Claude to ask questions and learn from user answers
  9. Session scanning batch-reviews past conversations to extract patterns
  10. Synthesis passes consolidate knowledge into higher-level principles
  11. Claude makes autonomous decisions based on learned principles without approval for reversible actions

  2. Claude stops and asks before external communications (emails, API calls to third parties)
  3. Claude stops and asks before actions that cost money above tracked thresholds
  4. Users can grant explicit permissions with stated limits (e.g., "max $20 on AWS")
