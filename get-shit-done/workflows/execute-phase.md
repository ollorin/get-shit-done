<purpose>
Execute all plans in a phase using wave-based parallel execution. Orchestrator stays lean — delegates plan execution to subagents.
</purpose>

<core_principle>
Orchestrator coordinates, not executes. Each subagent loads the full execute-plan context. Orchestrator: discover plans → analyze deps → group waves → spawn agents → handle checkpoints → collect results.
</core_principle>

## E2E Testing — Non-Negotiable Rules

These rules CANNOT be skipped, deferred, or deprioritized by any subagent:

1. **Every UI page created or modified MUST have e2e test coverage** — verified by post-execution inventory scan
2. **E2E tests MUST exercise ALL interactive elements** — not just "page loads"
3. **E2E tests MUST check for data display bugs** — NaN, undefined, null, [object Object], empty strings where values expected
4. **E2E tests MUST open every dropdown, modal, and sub-section** — visual completeness
5. **New regression-worthy tests MUST be tagged `regression`** — selected by test generator
6. **Pre-dev test generation (Step 5.6) and post-dev gap closure (Step 6.5) are MANDATORY for web phases** — not optional, not deferrable
7. **Subagents that skip or defer e2e testing will trigger verification failure** — QGATE-07 enforces this

<process>

<step name="initialize" priority="first">
Load all context in one call:

```bash
INIT=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js" init execute-phase "${PHASE_ARG}")
if [[ "$INIT" == @file:* ]]; then INIT=$(cat "${INIT#@file:}"); fi
```

Parse JSON for: `executor_model`, `verifier_model`, `commit_docs`, `parallelization`, `branching_strategy`, `branch_name`, `phase_found`, `phase_dir`, `phase_number`, `phase_name`, `phase_slug`, `plans`, `incomplete_plans`, `plan_count`, `incomplete_count`, `state_exists`, `roadmap_exists`, `phase_req_ids`.

**If `phase_found` is false:** Error — phase directory not found.
**If `plan_count` is 0:** Error — no plans found in phase.
**If `state_exists` is false but `.planning/` exists:** Offer reconstruct or continue.

When `parallelization` is false, plans within a wave execute sequentially.

**Sync chain flag with intent** — if user invoked manually (no `--auto`), clear the ephemeral chain flag from any previous interrupted `--auto` chain. This does NOT touch `workflow.auto_advance` (the user's persistent settings preference). Must happen before any config reads (checkpoint handling also reads auto-advance flags):
```bash
if [[ ! "$ARGUMENTS" =~ --auto ]]; then
  node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js" config-set workflow._auto_chain_active false 2>/dev/null

## Execution Plan

**Phase {X}: {Name}** — {total_plans} plans across {wave_count} waves

| Wave | Plans | What it builds |
|------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | 01-01, 01-02 | {from plan objectives, 3-8 words} |
| 2 | 01-03 | ... |
```
</step>

<step name="execute_waves">
Execute each wave in sequence. Within a wave: parallel if `PARALLELIZATION=true`, sequential if `false`.

Initialize context tracking: `COMPLETED_CONTEXT_BLOCK = ""` (updated after each wave completes).

**For each wave:**

1. **Describe what's being built (BEFORE spawning):**

   Read each plan's `<objective>`. Extract what's being built and why.

   ```
   ---
   ## Wave {N}

   **{Plan ID}: {Plan Name}**
   {2-3 sentences: what this builds, technical approach, why it matters}

   Spawning {count} agent(s)...
   ---
   ```

   - Bad: "Executing terrain generation plan"
   - Good: "Procedural terrain generator using Perlin noise — creates height maps, biome zones, and collision meshes. Required before vehicle physics can interact with ground."

2. **Spawn executor agents:**

   Pass paths only — executors read files themselves with their fresh 200k context.
   This keeps orchestrator context lean (~10-15%).

   **For Wave 1 executors** (wave_number == 1, no prior context):
   ```
   Agent(
     subagent_type="gsd-executor",
     model="{executor_model}",
     description="Execute plan {plan_number}",
     prompt="
       <objective>

       - ./CLAUDE.md (Project instructions, if exists — follow project-specific guidelines and coding conventions)

       </success_criteria>
     "
   )
   ```

3. **Wait for all agents in wave to complete.**

4. **Report completion — spot-check claims first:**

   For each SUMMARY.md:
   - Verify first 2 files from `key-files.created` exist on disk
   - Check `git log --oneline --all --grep="{phase}-{plan}"` returns ≥1 commit
   - Check for `## Self-Check: FAILED` marker

   If ANY spot-check fails: report which plan failed, route to failure handler — ask "Retry plan?" or "Continue with remaining waves?"

   If pass:
   ```
   ---
   ## Wave {N} Complete

   **{Plan ID}: {Plan Name}**
   {What was built — from SUMMARY.md}
   {Notable deviations, if any}

   {If more waves: what this enables for next wave}
   ---
   ```

   - Bad: "Wave 2 complete. Proceeding to Wave 3."
   - Good: "Terrain system complete — 3 biome types, height-based texturing, physics collision meshes. Vehicle physics (Wave 3) can now reference ground surfaces."

4.5. **Assemble completed_plans_context (only if a next wave exists):**

   After all spot-checks pass for the current wave, and if `current_wave < total_waves`:

   ```
   COMPLETED_CONTEXT_PARTS = []

   For each plan that has completed in waves 1..current_wave (all completed plans so far):
     SUMMARY_PATH = "{phase_dir}/{plan_id}-SUMMARY.md"
     If SUMMARY_PATH does not exist: skip this plan with warning "Skipping {plan_id} — SUMMARY.md not found"

     Extract from SUMMARY.md frontmatter:
       node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js" summary-extract "$SUMMARY_PATH" \
         --fields key-files,key-decisions,provides 2>/dev/null

     If extraction succeeds, read the one-liner (first **bold** line after the # heading in SUMMARY.md):
       ONE_LINER = first line matching /^\*\*.+\*\*/ in SUMMARY.md body

     Assemble context part:
       "Plan {plan_id} ({ONE_LINER or 'no one-liner'}):\n
        Files created: {key-files.created joined with ', ' or 'none'}\n
        Files modified: {key-files.modified joined with ', ' or 'none'}\n
        Key decisions: {key-decisions joined with '; ' or 'none'}\n
        Provides: {provides joined with ', ' or 'none'}"

     Append to COMPLETED_CONTEXT_PARTS

   COMPLETED_CONTEXT_BLOCK = COMPLETED_CONTEXT_PARTS joined with "\n\n"

   If COMPLETED_CONTEXT_BLOCK is empty (all extractions failed):
     COMPLETED_CONTEXT_BLOCK = "Prior wave plans completed but SUMMARY.md context unavailable — proceed based on plan files."
   ```

   Store COMPLETED_CONTEXT_BLOCK — it will be injected into Wave {current_wave + 1} executor spawns in step 2 above.

5. **Handle failures:**

   **Known Claude Code bug (classifyHandoffIfNeeded):** If an agent reports "failed" with error containing `classifyHandoffIfNeeded is not defined`, this is a Claude Code runtime bug — not a GSD or agent issue. The error fires in the completion handler AFTER all tool calls finish. In this case: run the same spot-checks as step 4 (SUMMARY.md exists, git commits present, no Self-Check: FAILED). If spot-checks PASS → treat as **successful**. If spot-checks FAIL → treat as real failure below.

   For real failures: report which plan failed → ask "Continue?" or "Stop?" → if continue, dependent plans may also fail. If stop, partial completion report.

6. **Execute checkpoint plans between waves** — see `<checkpoint_handling>`.

7. **Proceed to next wave.**
</step>

<step name="checkpoint_handling">
Plans with `autonomous: false` require user interaction.

**Auto-mode checkpoint handling:**

Read auto-advance config (chain flag + user preference):
```bash
AUTO_CHAIN=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js" config-get workflow._auto_chain_active 2>/dev/null || echo "false")
AUTO_CFG=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js" config-get workflow.auto_advance 2>/dev/null || echo "false")
```

When executor returns a checkpoint AND (`AUTO_CHAIN` is `"true"` OR `AUTO_CFG` is `"true"`):
- **human-verify** → Auto-spawn continuation agent with `{user_response}` = `"approved"`. Log `⚡ Auto-approved checkpoint`.
- **decision** → Auto-spawn continuation agent with `{user_response}` = first option from checkpoint details. Log `⚡ Auto-selected: [option]`.
- **human-action** → Present to user (existing behavior below). Auth gates cannot be automated.

**UI QA checkpoints — always auto-run (Charlotte is the human here):**

When executor returns `Type: ui-qa` — regardless of AUTO_CHAIN or AUTO_CFG:

1. Log: `⚡ UI QA: Starting Charlotte automated testing...`

2. **Auto-start dev servers** — do NOT ask user to start servers:
   - For each URL implied by `<what-built>` (default: http://localhost:3000):
     ```bash
     curl -s --max-time 3 http://localhost:3000 > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo UP || echo DOWN
     ```
   - If DOWN: detect framework and start in background:
     - NX monorepo: `npx nx dev {app-name}` (app name from checkpoint `<apps>` tag or CLAUDE.md)
     - Next.js/Vite/other: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` in background
   - Wait up to 30s for server to respond. If still DOWN after 30s: log warning, proceed anyway (Charlotte reports server errors as issues).

3. **Run Charlotte QA loop** (max 3 rounds):
   ```
   MAX_ROUNDS = 3
   round = 1
   qa_passed = false

   while round <= MAX_ROUNDS AND qa_passed == false:
     qa_result = Agent(
       subagent_type="gsd-charlotte-qa",
       model="haiku",
       description="UI QA round {round}",
       prompt="mode=ui-qa\n<what_built>{what_built}</what_built>\n<test_flows>{test_flows}</test_flows>\n<round>{round}</round>{IF round > 1: <previous_issues>{previous_report}</previous_issues>}"
     )

     if qa_result.passed:
       qa_passed = true
       break

     if round == MAX_ROUNDS:
       Present ONLY the issue report — NOT server start instructions:
       "Charlotte found {N} issues after {MAX_ROUNDS} rounds. Type 'continue' to proceed, or describe what to fix."
       Wait for user response. If 'continue': break. Else: spawn fix agent, re-run QA.
       break

     FIX_TIER = qa_result.severity_counts.critical > 0 OR qa_result.severity_counts.high > 0 ? "sonnet" : "haiku"
     Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="{FIX_TIER}", description="Fix UI issues round {round}",
       prompt="Fix these UI issues: {qa_result.report_markdown}\nCommit each fix atomically.")
     round++
   ```

4. Spawn continuation agent with `{user_response}` = "Charlotte QA passed" (or issue summary if not passed).
5. Log: `⚡ UI QA: {passed/failed} — {N} issues {found/fixed}`

**Standard flow (not auto-mode, or human-action type):**

1. Spawn agent for checkpoint plan
2. Agent runs until checkpoint task or auth gate → returns structured state
3. Agent return includes: completed tasks table, current task + blocker, checkpoint type/details, what's awaited
4. **Present to user:**
   ```
   ## Checkpoint: [Type]

   **Plan:** 03-03 Dashboard Layout
   **Progress:** 2/3 tasks complete

   [Checkpoint Details from agent return]
   [Awaiting section from agent return]
   ```
5. User responds: "approved"/"done" | issue description | decision selection
6. **Spawn continuation agent (NOT resume)** using continuation-prompt.md template:
   - `{completed_tasks_table}`: From checkpoint return
   - `{resume_task_number}` + `{resume_task_name}`: Current task
   - `{user_response}`: What user provided
   - `{resume_instructions}`: Based on checkpoint type
7. Continuation agent verifies previous commits, continues from resume point
8. Repeat until plan completes or user stops

**Why fresh agent, not resume:** Resume relies on internal serialization that breaks with parallel tool calls. Fresh agents with explicit state are more reliable.

**Checkpoints in parallel waves:** Agent pauses and returns while other parallel agents may complete. Present checkpoint, spawn continuation, wait for all before next wave.

<step name="pre_verify_gates">

### Step 6.4: Pre-Verification Gates (BLOCKING)

Before proceeding to verification, these gates must pass. They cannot be deferred.

**Gate 1 — Charlotte QA evidence (UI phases only):**

If any plan in this phase has `type: frontend` or `checkpoint: ui-qa` or created `.tsx/.jsx` files:
- CHECKPOINT.json must contain `charlotte_qa_ran: true`
- If missing: the orchestrator (execute-roadmap step 5a) will catch this and run Charlotte
- Set `charlotte_qa_ran: false` in CHECKPOINT.json if Charlotte was not run — do NOT omit the field

**Gate 2 — Integration tests green:**

All integration tests must pass before SUMMARY.md is considered complete:
```bash
cd apps/api && NODE_ENV=test DENO_ENV=test deno task test:ci
```
If failures: fix before proceeding. Do not write "tests pass" in SUMMARY.md if they don't.

**Gate 3 — Cross-layer consistency (if phase added enums, types, or status values):**

If the phase introduced a new enum value, status string, or type discriminator:
- Verify it exists in ALL layers: DB constraint, RPC validation, edge function validation, frontend type, UI display map
- A value present in one layer but missing in another is a blocking defect

</step>

<step name="e2e_coverage_closure">

### Step 6.5: Post-Execution E2E Coverage Closure (Web Projects)

**Trigger:** Same as Step 5.6 in plan-phase — web project with UI changes.

**Process:**
1. Read SUMMARY.md to identify what was actually built
2. Spawn gsd-ui-inventory (haiku) on the changed modules to get fresh inventory
3. Compare actual UI inventory against E2E-TEST-PLAN.md from planning phase
4. If gaps found (new UI elements not covered by any test):
   a. Spawn gsd-e2e-test-generator (sonnet) with gap list
   b. Generator creates additional scenarios
   c. Run new scenarios with Charlotte to verify they work
5. Update scenario index files to include new tests
6. Tag new tests and select regression candidates:
   - Tests covering core user flows → `regression`
   - Tests covering edge cases → `functional`
   - Tests covering visual quality → `ux`

**Hard rule:** Phase execution is NOT complete until every UI page created/modified has at least one e2e scenario covering:
- Page loads without console errors
- All interactive elements are clickable/fillable
- All data displays show valid values (no NaN, undefined, null)
- All forms submit successfully with valid data
- All forms show validation errors with invalid data

**Output:** Updated scenarios in `apps/e2e-charlotte/scenarios/`, updated E2E-TEST-PLAN.md with coverage status.

</step>

<step name="close_parent_artifacts">
**For decimal/polish phases only (X.Y pattern):** Close the feedback loop by resolving parent UAT and debug artifacts.

**Skip if** phase number has no decimal (e.g., `3`, `04`) — only applies to gap-closure phases like `4.1`, `03.1`.

**1. Detect decimal phase and derive parent:**
```bash
# Check if phase_number contains a decimal
if [[ "$PHASE_NUMBER" == *.* ]]; then
  PARENT_PHASE="${PHASE_NUMBER%%.*}"
fi
```

**2. Find parent UAT file:**
```bash
PARENT_INFO=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js" find-phase "${PARENT_PHASE}" --raw)
# Extract directory from PARENT_INFO JSON, then find UAT file in that directory
```

**If no parent UAT found:** Skip this step (gap-closure may have been triggered by VERIFICATION.md instead).

**3. Update UAT gap statuses:**

Read the parent UAT file's `## Gaps` section. For each gap entry with `status: failed`:
- Update to `status: resolved`

**4. Update UAT frontmatter:**

If all gaps now have `status: resolved`:
- Update frontmatter `status: diagnosed` → `status: resolved`
- Update frontmatter `updated:` timestamp

**5. Resolve referenced debug sessions:**

For each gap that has a `debug_session:` field:
- Read the debug session file
- Update frontmatter `status:` → `resolved`
- Update frontmatter `updated:` timestamp
- Move to resolved directory:
```bash
mkdir -p .planning/debug/resolved
mv .planning/debug/{slug}.md .planning/debug/resolved/
```

**6. Commit updated artifacts:**
```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js" commit "docs(phase-${PARENT_PHASE}): resolve UAT gaps and debug sessions after ${PHASE_NUMBER} gap closure" --files .planning/phases/*${PARENT_PHASE}*/*-UAT.md .planning/debug/resolved/*.md

node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js" commit "docs(phase-{X}): complete phase execution" --files .planning/ROADMAP.md .planning/STATE.md .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md {phase_dir}/*-VERIFICATION.md
```

<step name="offer_next">

**Exception:** If `gaps_found`, the `verify_phase_goal` step already presents the gap-closure path (`/gsd:plan-phase {X} --gaps`). No additional routing needed — skip auto-advance.

**No-transition check (spawned by auto-advance chain):**

Parse `--no-transition` flag from $ARGUMENTS.

**If `--no-transition` flag present:**

Execute-phase was spawned by plan-phase's auto-advance. Do NOT run transition.md.
After verification passes and roadmap is updated, return completion status to parent:

```
## PHASE COMPLETE

Phase: ${PHASE_NUMBER} - ${PHASE_NAME}
Plans: ${completed_count}/${total_count}
Verification: {Passed | Gaps Found}

[Include aggregate_results output]
```

STOP. Do not proceed to auto-advance or transition.

**If `--no-transition` flag is NOT present:**

**Auto-advance detection:**

1. Parse `--auto` flag from $ARGUMENTS
2. Read both the chain flag and user preference (chain flag already synced in init step):
   ```bash
   AUTO_CHAIN=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js" config-get workflow._auto_chain_active 2>/dev/null || echo "false")
   AUTO_CFG=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.js" config-get workflow.auto_advance 2>/dev/null || echo "false")
   ```

**If `--auto` flag present OR `AUTO_CHAIN` is true OR `AUTO_CFG` is true (AND verification passed with no gaps):**

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  AUTO-ADVANCING → TRANSITION             ║
║  Phase {X} verified, continuing chain    ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Execute the transition workflow inline (do NOT use Task — orchestrator context is ~10-15%, transition needs phase completion data already in context):

Read and follow `~/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/transition.md`, passing through the `--auto` flag so it propagates to the next phase invocation.

**If neither `--auto` nor `AUTO_CFG` is true:**

The workflow ends. The user runs `/gsd:progress` or invokes the transition workflow manually.

<context_efficiency>
Orchestrator: ~10-15% context. Subagents: fresh 200k each. No polling (Task blocks). No context bleed.
</context_efficiency>

<failure_handling>
- **classifyHandoffIfNeeded false failure:** Agent reports "failed" but error is `classifyHandoffIfNeeded is not defined` → Claude Code bug, not GSD. Spot-check (SUMMARY exists, commits present) → if pass, treat as success
- **Agent fails mid-plan:** Missing SUMMARY.md → report, ask user how to proceed
- **Dependency chain breaks:** Wave 1 fails → Wave 2 dependents likely fail → user chooses attempt or skip
- **All agents in wave fail:** Systemic issue → stop, report for investigation
- **Checkpoint unresolvable:** "Skip this plan?" or "Abort phase execution?" → record partial progress in STATE.md
</failure_handling>

<resumption>
Re-run `/gsd:execute-phase {phase}` → discover_plans finds completed SUMMARYs → skips them → resumes from first incomplete plan → continues wave execution.

STATE.md tracks: last completed plan, current wave, pending checkpoints.
</resumption>
