<objective>
Execute all plans in a phase using wave-based parallel execution.

Orchestrator stays lean: discover plans, analyze dependencies, group into waves, spawn subagents, collect results. Each subagent loads the full execute-plan context and handles its own plan.

Context budget: ~15% orchestrator, 100% fresh per subagent.

Phase: $ARGUMENTS

**Version-skew preflight:** Before executing, read `~/.claude/cache/gsd-skew-check.json` if it exists. If `drifted_count > 0`, the installed GSD copy has drifted from its source — warn the user (name the drifted files if listed) and offer to stop and re-run the installer before proceeding.

**Flags:**
- `--gaps-only` — Execute only gap closure plans (plans with `gap_closure: true` in frontmatter). Use after verify-work creates fix plans.

<process>
Execute the execute-phase workflow from @~/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/execute-phase.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (wave execution, checkpoint handling, verification, state updates, routing).
