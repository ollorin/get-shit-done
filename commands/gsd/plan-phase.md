<objective>
Create executable phase prompts (PLAN.md files) for a roadmap phase with integrated research and verification.

**Default flow:** Research (if needed) → Plan → Verify → Done

**Orchestrator role:** Parse arguments, validate phase, research domain (unless skipped), spawn gsd-planner, verify with gsd-plan-checker, iterate until pass or max iterations, present results.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@~/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/plan-phase.md
@~/.claude/get-shit-done/references/ui-brand.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Phase number: $ARGUMENTS (optional — auto-detects next unplanned phase if omitted)

**Version-skew preflight:** Before executing, read `~/.claude/cache/gsd-skew-check.json` if it exists. If `drifted_count > 0`, the installed GSD copy has drifted from its source — warn the user (name the drifted files if listed) and offer to stop and re-run the installer before proceeding.

**Flags** (`--research`, `--skip-research`, `--gaps`, `--skip-verify`) are defined and handled in the workflow file — see `argument-hint` for the list and pass `$ARGUMENTS` through verbatim. Do NOT duplicate their semantics here; the workflow is the single source of truth.

Normalize phase input in step 2 before any directory lookups.
</context>

<process>
Execute the plan-phase workflow from @~/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/plan-phase.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (validation, research, planning, verification loop, routing).
</process>
